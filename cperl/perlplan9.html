<p>perlplan9 - Plan 9-specific documentation for Perl</p>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>These are a few notes describing features peculiar to Plan 9 Perl. As such, it is not intended to be a replacement for the rest of the Perl 5 documentation (which is both copious and excellent). If you have any questions to which you can&#39;t find answers in these man pages, contact Luther Huffman at lutherh@stratcom.com and we&#39;ll try to answer them.</p>

<h2 id="Invoking-Perl">Invoking Perl</h2>

<p>Perl is invoked from the command line as described in <a href="/cperl/perl.html">perl</a>. Most perl scripts, however, do have a first line such as &quot;#!/usr/local/bin/perl&quot;. This is known as a shebang (shell-bang) statement and tells the OS shell where to find the perl interpreter. In Plan 9 Perl this statement should be &quot;#!/bin/perl&quot; if you wish to be able to directly invoke the script by its name. Alternatively, you may invoke perl with the command &quot;Perl&quot; instead of &quot;perl&quot;. This will produce Acme-friendly error messages of the form &quot;filename:18&quot;.</p>

<p>Some scripts, usually identified with a *.PL extension, are self-configuring and are able to correctly create their own shebang path from config information located in Plan 9 Perl. These you won&#39;t need to be worried about.</p>

<h2 id="Whats-in-Plan-9-Perl">What&#39;s in Plan 9 Perl</h2>

<p>Although Plan 9 Perl currently only provides static loading, it is built with a number of useful extensions. These include Opcode, FileHandle, Fcntl, and POSIX. Expect to see others (and DynaLoading!) in the future.</p>

<h2 id="Whats-not-in-Plan-9-Perl">What&#39;s not in Plan 9 Perl</h2>

<p>As mentioned previously, dynamic loading isn&#39;t currently available nor is MakeMaker. Both are high-priority items.</p>

<h2 id="Perl5-Functions-not-currently-supported-in-Plan-9-Perl">Perl5 Functions not currently supported in Plan 9 Perl</h2>

<p>Some, such as <code>chown</code> and <code>umask</code> aren&#39;t provided because the concept does not exist within Plan 9. Others, such as some of the socket-related functions, simply haven&#39;t been written yet. Many in the latter category may be supported in the future.</p>

<p>The functions not currently implemented include:</p>

<pre><code>    chown, chroot, dbmclose, dbmopen, getsockopt, 
    setsockopt, recvmsg, sendmsg, getnetbyname, 
    getnetbyaddr, getnetent, getprotoent, getservent, 
    sethostent, setnetent, setprotoent, setservent, 
    endservent, endnetent, endprotoent, umask</code></pre>

<p>There may be several other functions that have undefined behavior so this list shouldn&#39;t be considered complete.</p>

<h2 id="Signals-in-Plan-9-Perl">Signals in Plan 9 Perl</h2>

<p>For compatibility with perl scripts written for the Unix environment, Plan 9 Perl uses the POSIX signal emulation provided in Plan 9&#39;s ANSI POSIX Environment (APE). Signal stacking isn&#39;t supported. The signals provided are:</p>

<pre><code>    SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGQUIT, SIGILL, SIGABRT,
    SIGFPE, SIGKILL, SIGSEGV, SIGPIPE, SIGPIPE, SIGALRM, 
    SIGTERM, SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2, SIGCHLD, SIGCONT,
    SIGSTOP, SIGTSTP, SIGTTIN, SIGTTOU</code></pre>

<h1 id="COMPILING-AND-INSTALLING-PERL-ON-PLAN-9">COMPILING AND INSTALLING PERL ON PLAN 9</h1>

<p>WELCOME to Plan 9 Perl, brave soul!</p>

<pre><code>   This is a preliminary alpha version of Plan 9 Perl. Still to be
implemented are MakeMaker and DynaLoader. Many perl commands are
missing or currently behave in an inscrutable manner. These gaps will,
with perseverance and a modicum of luck, be remedied in the near
future.To install this software:</code></pre>

<p>1. Create the source directories and libraries for perl by running the plan9/setup.rc command (i.e., located in the plan9 subdirectory). Note: the setup routine assumes that you haven&#39;t dearchived these files into /sys/src/cmd/perl. After running setup.rc you may delete the copy of the source you originally detarred, as source code has now been installed in /sys/src/cmd/perl. If you plan on installing perl binaries for all architectures, run &quot;setup.rc -a&quot;.</p>

<p>2. After making sure that you have adequate privileges to build system software, from /sys/src/cmd/perl/5.00301 (adjust version appropriately) run:</p>

<pre><code>        mk install</code></pre>

<p>If you wish to install perl versions for all architectures (68020, mips, sparc and 386) run:</p>

<pre><code>        mk installall</code></pre>

<p>3. Wait. The build process will take a *long* time because perl bootstraps itself. A 75MHz Pentium, 16MB RAM machine takes roughly 30 minutes to build the distribution from scratch.</p>

<h2 id="Installing-Perl-Documentation-on-Plan-9">Installing Perl Documentation on Plan 9</h2>

<p>This perl distribution comes with a tremendous amount of documentation. To add these to the built-in manuals that come with Plan 9, from /sys/src/cmd/perl/5.00301 (adjust version appropriately) run:</p>

<pre><code>        mk man</code></pre>

<p>To begin your reading, start with:</p>

<pre><code>        man perl</code></pre>

<p>This is a good introduction and will direct you towards other man pages that may interest you.</p>

<p>(Note: &quot;mk man&quot; may produce some extraneous noise. Fear not.)</p>
