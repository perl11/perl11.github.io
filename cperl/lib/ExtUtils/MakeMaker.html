<p>ExtUtils::MakeMaker - Create a module Makefile</p>

<h1 id="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</h1>

<pre><code>  use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;

  WriteMakefile(
      NAME              =&gt; &quot;Foo::Bar&quot;,
      VERSION_FROM      =&gt; &quot;lib/Foo/Bar.pm&quot;,
  );</code></pre>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>This utility is designed to write a Makefile for an extension module from a Makefile.PL. It is based on the Makefile.SH model provided by Andy Dougherty and the perl5-porters.</p>

<p>It splits the task of generating the Makefile into several subroutines that can be individually overridden. Each subroutine returns the text it wishes to have written to the Makefile.</p>

<p>As there are various Make programs with incompatible syntax, which use operating system shells, again with incompatible syntax, it is important for users of this module to know which flavour of Make a Makefile has been written for so they&#39;ll use the correct one and won&#39;t have to face the possibly bewildering errors resulting from using the wrong one.</p>

<p>On POSIX systems, that program will likely be GNU Make; on Microsoft Windows, it will be either Microsoft NMake, DMake or GNU Make. See the section on the <a href="#MAKE">&quot;MAKE&quot;</a> parameter for details.</p>

<p>ExtUtils::MakeMaker (EUMM) is object oriented. Each directory below the current directory that contains a Makefile.PL is treated as a separate object. This makes it possible to write an unlimited number of Makefiles with a single invocation of WriteMakefile().</p>

<p>All inputs to WriteMakefile are Unicode characters, not just octets. EUMM seeks to handle all of these correctly. It is currently still not possible to portably use Unicode characters in module names, because this requires Perl to handle Unicode filenames, which is not yet the case on Windows.</p>

<h2 id="How-To-Write-A-Makefile.PL">How To Write A Makefile.PL</h2>

<p>See <a href="/cperl/lib/ExtUtils/MakeMaker/Tutorial.html">ExtUtils::MakeMaker::Tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>The long answer is the rest of the manpage :-)</p>

<h2 id="Default-Makefile-Behaviour">Default Makefile Behaviour</h2>

<p>The generated Makefile enables the user of the extension to invoke</p>

<pre><code>  perl Makefile.PL # optionally &quot;perl Makefile.PL verbose&quot;
  make
  make test        # optionally set TEST_VERBOSE=1
  make install     # See below</code></pre>

<p>The Makefile to be produced may be altered by adding arguments of the form <code>KEY=VALUE</code>. E.g.</p>

<pre><code>  perl Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=~</code></pre>

<p>Other interesting targets in the generated Makefile are</p>

<pre><code>  make config     # to check if the Makefile is up-to-date
  make clean      # delete local temp files (Makefile gets renamed)
  make realclean  # delete derived files (including ./blib)
  make ci         # check in all the files in the MANIFEST file
  make dist       # see below the Distribution Support section</code></pre>

<h2 id="make-test">make test</h2>

<p>MakeMaker checks for the existence of a file named <i>test.pl</i> in the current directory, and if it exists it executes the script with the proper set of perl <code>-I</code> options.</p>

<p>MakeMaker also checks for any files matching glob(&quot;t/*.t&quot;). It will execute all matching files in alphabetical order via the <a href="/cperl/lib/Test/Harness.html">Test::Harness</a> module with the <code>-I</code> switches set correctly.</p>

<p>If you&#39;d like to see the raw output of your tests, set the <code>TEST_VERBOSE</code> variable to true.</p>

<pre><code>  make test TEST_VERBOSE=1</code></pre>

<p>If you want to run particular test files, set the <code>TEST_FILES</code> variable. It is possible to use globbing with this mechanism.</p>

<pre><code>  make test TEST_FILES=&#39;t/foobar.t t/dagobah*.t&#39;</code></pre>

<p>Windows users who are using <code>nmake</code> should note that due to a bug in <code>nmake</code>, when specifying <code>TEST_FILES</code> you must use back-slashes instead of forward-slashes.</p>

<pre><code>  nmake test TEST_FILES=&#39;t\foobar.t t\dagobah*.t&#39;</code></pre>

<h2 id="make-testdb">make testdb</h2>

<p>A useful variation of the above is the target <code>testdb</code>. It runs the test under the Perl debugger (see <a href="/cperl/perldebug.html">perldebug</a>). If the file <i>test.pl</i> exists in the current directory, it is used for the test.</p>

<p>If you want to debug some other testfile, set the <code>TEST_FILE</code> variable thusly:</p>

<pre><code>  make testdb TEST_FILE=t/mytest.t</code></pre>

<p>By default the debugger is called using <code>-d</code> option to perl. If you want to specify some other option, set the <code>TESTDB_SW</code> variable:</p>

<pre><code>  make testdb TESTDB_SW=-Dx</code></pre>

<h2 id="make-install">make install</h2>

<p>make alone puts all relevant files into directories that are named by the macros INST_LIB, INST_ARCHLIB, INST_SCRIPT, INST_MAN1DIR and INST_MAN3DIR. All these default to something below ./blib if you are <i>not</i> building below the perl source directory. If you <i>are</i> building below the perl source, INST_LIB and INST_ARCHLIB default to ../../lib, and INST_SCRIPT is not defined.</p>

<p>The <i>install</i> target of the generated Makefile copies the files found below each of the INST_* directories to their INSTALL* counterparts. Which counterparts are chosen depends on the setting of INSTALLDIRS according to the following table:</p>

<pre><code>                                 INSTALLDIRS set to
                           perl        site          vendor

                 PERLPREFIX      SITEPREFIX          VENDORPREFIX
  INST_ARCHLIB   INSTALLARCHLIB  INSTALLSITEARCH     INSTALLVENDORARCH
  INST_LIB       INSTALLPRIVLIB  INSTALLSITELIB      INSTALLVENDORLIB
  INST_BIN       INSTALLBIN      INSTALLSITEBIN      INSTALLVENDORBIN
  INST_SCRIPT    INSTALLSCRIPT   INSTALLSITESCRIPT   INSTALLVENDORSCRIPT
  INST_MAN1DIR   INSTALLMAN1DIR  INSTALLSITEMAN1DIR  INSTALLVENDORMAN1DIR
  INST_MAN3DIR   INSTALLMAN3DIR  INSTALLSITEMAN3DIR  INSTALLVENDORMAN3DIR</code></pre>

<p>The INSTALL... macros in turn default to their %Config ($Config{installprivlib}, $Config{installarchlib}, etc.) counterparts.</p>

<p>You can check the values of these variables on your system with</p>

<pre><code>    perl &#39;-V:install.*&#39;</code></pre>

<p>And to check the sequence in which the library directories are searched by perl, run</p>

<pre><code>    perl -le &#39;print join $/, @INC&#39;</code></pre>

<p>Sometimes older versions of the module you&#39;re installing live in other directories in @INC. Because Perl loads the first version of a module it finds, not the newest, you might accidentally get one of these older versions even after installing a brand new version. To delete <i>all other versions of the module you&#39;re installing</i> (not simply older ones) set the <code>UNINST</code> variable.</p>

<pre><code>    make install UNINST=1</code></pre>

<h2 id="INSTALL_BASE">INSTALL_BASE</h2>

<p>INSTALL_BASE can be passed into Makefile.PL to change where your module will be installed. INSTALL_BASE is more like what everyone else calls &quot;prefix&quot; than PREFIX is.</p>

<p>To have everything installed in your home directory, do the following.</p>

<pre><code>    # Unix users, INSTALL_BASE=~ works fine
    perl Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=/path/to/your/home/dir</code></pre>

<p>Like PREFIX, it sets several INSTALL* attributes at once. Unlike PREFIX it is easy to predict where the module will end up. The installation pattern looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>    INSTALLARCHLIB     INSTALL_BASE/lib/perl5/$Config{archname}
    INSTALLPRIVLIB     INSTALL_BASE/lib/perl5
    INSTALLBIN         INSTALL_BASE/bin
    INSTALLSCRIPT      INSTALL_BASE/bin
    INSTALLMAN1DIR     INSTALL_BASE/man/man1
    INSTALLMAN3DIR     INSTALL_BASE/man/man3</code></pre>

<p>INSTALL_BASE in MakeMaker and <code>--install_base</code> in Module::Build (as of 0.28) install to the same location. If you want MakeMaker and Module::Build to install to the same location simply set INSTALL_BASE and <code>--install_base</code> to the same location.</p>

<p>INSTALL_BASE was added in 6.31.</p>

<h2 id="PREFIX-and-LIB-attribute">PREFIX and LIB attribute</h2>

<p>PREFIX and LIB can be used to set several INSTALL* attributes in one go. Here&#39;s an example for installing into your home directory.</p>

<pre><code>    # Unix users, PREFIX=~ works fine
    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/path/to/your/home/dir</code></pre>

<p>This will install all files in the module under your home directory, with man pages and libraries going into an appropriate place (usually ~/man and ~/lib). How the exact location is determined is complicated and depends on how your Perl was configured. INSTALL_BASE works more like what other build systems call &quot;prefix&quot; than PREFIX and we recommend you use that instead.</p>

<p>Another way to specify many INSTALL directories with a single parameter is LIB.</p>

<pre><code>    perl Makefile.PL LIB=~/lib</code></pre>

<p>This will install the module&#39;s architecture-independent files into ~/lib, the architecture-dependent files into ~/lib/$archname.</p>

<p>Note, that in both cases the tilde expansion is done by MakeMaker, not by perl by default, nor by make.</p>

<p>Conflicts between parameters LIB, PREFIX and the various INSTALL* arguments are resolved so that:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>setting LIB overrides any setting of INSTALLPRIVLIB, INSTALLARCHLIB, INSTALLSITELIB, INSTALLSITEARCH (and they are not affected by PREFIX);</p>

</li>
<li><p>without LIB, setting PREFIX replaces the initial <code>$Config{prefix}</code> part of those INSTALL* arguments, even if the latter are explicitly set (but are set to still start with <code>$Config{prefix}</code>).</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>If the user has superuser privileges, and is not working on AFS or relatives, then the defaults for INSTALLPRIVLIB, INSTALLARCHLIB, INSTALLSCRIPT, etc. will be appropriate, and this incantation will be the best:</p>

<pre><code>    perl Makefile.PL;
    make;
    make test
    make install</code></pre>

<p>make install by default writes some documentation of what has been done into the file <code>$(INSTALLARCHLIB)/perllocal.pod</code>. This feature can be bypassed by calling make pure_install.</p>

<h2 id="AFS-users">AFS users</h2>

<p>will have to specify the installation directories as these most probably have changed since perl itself has been installed. They will have to do this by calling</p>

<pre><code>    perl Makefile.PL INSTALLSITELIB=/afs/here/today \
        INSTALLSCRIPT=/afs/there/now INSTALLMAN3DIR=/afs/for/manpages
    make</code></pre>

<p>Be careful to repeat this procedure every time you recompile an extension, unless you are sure the AFS installation directories are still valid.</p>

<h2 id="Static-Linking-of-a-new-Perl-Binary">Static Linking of a new Perl Binary</h2>

<p>An extension that is built with the above steps is ready to use on systems supporting dynamic loading. On systems that do not support dynamic loading, any newly created extension has to be linked together with the available resources. MakeMaker supports the linking process by creating appropriate targets in the Makefile whenever an extension is built. You can invoke the corresponding section of the makefile with</p>

<pre><code>    make perl</code></pre>

<p>That produces a new perl binary in the current directory with all extensions linked in that can be found in INST_ARCHLIB, SITELIBEXP, and PERL_ARCHLIB. To do that, MakeMaker writes a new Makefile, on UNIX, this is called <i>Makefile.aperl</i> (may be system dependent). If you want to force the creation of a new perl, it is recommended that you delete this <i>Makefile.aperl</i>, so the directories are searched through for linkable libraries again.</p>

<p>The binary can be installed into the directory where perl normally resides on your machine with</p>

<pre><code>    make inst_perl</code></pre>

<p>To produce a perl binary with a different name than <code>perl</code>, either say</p>

<pre><code>    perl Makefile.PL MAP_TARGET=myperl
    make myperl
    make inst_perl</code></pre>

<p>or say</p>

<pre><code>    perl Makefile.PL
    make myperl MAP_TARGET=myperl
    make inst_perl MAP_TARGET=myperl</code></pre>

<p>In any case you will be prompted with the correct invocation of the <code>inst_perl</code> target that installs the new binary into INSTALLBIN.</p>

<p>make inst_perl by default writes some documentation of what has been done into the file <code>$(INSTALLARCHLIB)/perllocal.pod</code>. This can be bypassed by calling make pure_inst_perl.</p>

<p>Warning: the inst_perl: target will most probably overwrite your existing perl binary. Use with care!</p>

<p>Sometimes you might want to build a statically linked perl although your system supports dynamic loading. In this case you may explicitly set the linktype with the invocation of the Makefile.PL or make:</p>

<pre><code>    perl Makefile.PL LINKTYPE=static    # recommended</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>    make LINKTYPE=static                # works on most systems</code></pre>

<h2 id="Determination-of-Perl-Library-and-Installation-Locations">Determination of Perl Library and Installation Locations</h2>

<p>MakeMaker needs to know, or to guess, where certain things are located. Especially INST_LIB and INST_ARCHLIB (where to put the files during the make(1) run), PERL_LIB and PERL_ARCHLIB (where to read existing modules from), and PERL_INC (header files and <code>libperl*.*</code>).</p>

<p>Extensions may be built either using the contents of the perl source directory tree or from the installed perl library. The recommended way is to build extensions after you have run &#39;make install&#39; on perl itself. You can do that in any directory on your hard disk that is not below the perl source tree. The support for extensions below the ext directory of the perl distribution is only good for the standard extensions that come with perl.</p>

<p>If an extension is being built below the <code>ext/</code> <code>cpan/</code> or <code>dist/</code> directory of the perl source and PERL_CORE=1 is defined then MakeMaker will set PERL_SRC automatically (e.g., <code>../..</code>). If PERL_SRC is defined and the extension is recognized as a standard extension, then other variables default to the following:</p>

<pre><code>  PERL_INC     = PERL_SRC
  PERL_LIB     = PERL_SRC/lib
  PERL_ARCHLIB = PERL_SRC/lib
  INST_LIB     = PERL_LIB
  INST_ARCHLIB = PERL_ARCHLIB</code></pre>

<p>If an extension is being built away from the perl source then MakeMaker will leave PERL_SRC undefined and default to using the installed copy of the perl library. The other variables default to the following:</p>

<pre><code>  PERL_INC     = $archlibexp/CORE
  PERL_LIB     = $privlibexp
  PERL_ARCHLIB = $archlibexp
  INST_LIB     = ./blib/lib
  INST_ARCHLIB = ./blib/arch</code></pre>

<p>If perl has not yet been installed then PERL_SRC can be defined on the command line as shown in the previous section.</p>

<h2 id="Which-architecture-dependent-directory">Which architecture dependent directory?</h2>

<p>If you don&#39;t want to keep the defaults for the INSTALL* macros, MakeMaker helps you to minimize the typing needed: the usual relationship between INSTALLPRIVLIB and INSTALLARCHLIB is determined by Configure at perl compilation time. MakeMaker supports the user who sets INSTALLPRIVLIB. If INSTALLPRIVLIB is set, but INSTALLARCHLIB not, then MakeMaker defaults the latter to be the same subdirectory of INSTALLPRIVLIB as Configure decided for the counterparts in %Config, otherwise it defaults to INSTALLPRIVLIB. The same relationship holds for INSTALLSITELIB and INSTALLSITEARCH.</p>

<p>MakeMaker gives you much more freedom than needed to configure internal variables and get different results. It is worth mentioning that make(1) also lets you configure most of the variables that are used in the Makefile. But in the majority of situations this will not be necessary, and should only be done if the author of a package recommends it (or you know what you&#39;re doing).</p>

<h2 id="Using-Attributes-and-Parameters">Using Attributes and Parameters</h2>

<p>The following attributes may be specified as arguments to WriteMakefile() or as NAME=VALUE pairs on the command line. Attributes that became available with later versions of MakeMaker are indicated.</p>

<p>In order to maintain portability of attributes with older versions of MakeMaker you may want to use <a>App::EUMM::Upgrade</a> with your <code>Makefile.PL</code>.</p>

<dl>

<dt id="ABSTRACT">ABSTRACT</dt>
<dd>

<p>One line description of the module. Will be included in PPD file.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="ABSTRACT_FROM">ABSTRACT_FROM</dt>
<dd>

<p>Name of the file that contains the package description. MakeMaker looks for a line in the POD matching /^($package\s-\s)(.*)/. This is typically the first line in the &quot;=head1 NAME&quot; section. $2 becomes the abstract.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="AUTHOR">AUTHOR</dt>
<dd>

<p>Array of strings containing name (and email address) of package author(s). Is used in CPAN Meta files (META.yml or META.json) and PPD (Perl Package Description) files for PPM (Perl Package Manager).</p>

</dd>
<dt id="BINARY_LOCATION">BINARY_LOCATION</dt>
<dd>

<p>Used when creating PPD files for binary packages. It can be set to a full or relative path or URL to the binary archive for a particular architecture. For example:</p>

<pre><code>        perl Makefile.PL BINARY_LOCATION=x86/Agent.tar.gz</code></pre>

<p>builds a PPD package that references a binary of the <code>Agent</code> package, located in the <code>x86</code> directory relative to the PPD itself.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="BUILD_REQUIRES">BUILD_REQUIRES</dt>
<dd>

<p>Available in version 6.5503 and above.</p>

<p>A hash of modules that are needed to build your module but not run it.</p>

<p>This will go into the <code>build_requires</code> field of your <i>META.yml</i> and the <code>build</code> of the <code>prereqs</code> field of your <i>META.json</i>.</p>

<p>Defaults to <code>{ &quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker&quot; =&gt; 0 }</code> if this attribute is not specified.</p>

<p>The format is the same as PREREQ_PM.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="C">C</dt>
<dd>

<p>Ref to array of *.c file names. Initialised from a directory scan and the values portion of the XS attribute hash. This is not currently used by MakeMaker but may be handy in Makefile.PLs.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="CCFLAGS">CCFLAGS</dt>
<dd>

<p>String that will be included in the compiler call command line between the arguments INC and OPTIMIZE.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="CONFIG">CONFIG</dt>
<dd>

<p>Arrayref. E.g. [qw(archname manext)] defines ARCHNAME &amp; MANEXT from config.sh. MakeMaker will add to CONFIG the following values anyway: ar cc cccdlflags ccdlflags dlext dlsrc ld lddlflags ldflags libc lib_ext obj_ext ranlib sitelibexp sitearchexp so</p>

</dd>
<dt id="CONFIGURE">CONFIGURE</dt>
<dd>

<p>CODE reference. The subroutine should return a hash reference. The hash may contain further attributes, e.g. {LIBS =&gt; ...}, that have to be determined by some evaluation method.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="CONFIGURE_REQUIRES">CONFIGURE_REQUIRES</dt>
<dd>

<p>Available in version 6.52 and above.</p>

<p>A hash of modules that are required to run Makefile.PL itself, but not to run your distribution.</p>

<p>This will go into the <code>configure_requires</code> field of your <i>META.yml</i> and the <code>configure</code> of the <code>prereqs</code> field of your <i>META.json</i>.</p>

<p>Defaults to <code>{ &quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker&quot; =&gt; 0 }</code> if this attribute is not specified.</p>

<p>The format is the same as PREREQ_PM.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="DEFINE">DEFINE</dt>
<dd>

<p>Something like <code>&quot;-DHAVE_UNISTD_H&quot;</code></p>

</dd>
<dt id="DESTDIR">DESTDIR</dt>
<dd>

<p>This is the root directory into which the code will be installed. It <i>prepends itself to the normal prefix</i>. For example, if your code would normally go into <i>/usr/local/lib/perl</i> you could set DESTDIR=~/tmp/ and installation would go into <i>~/tmp/usr/local/lib/perl</i>.</p>

<p>This is primarily of use for people who repackage Perl modules.</p>

<p>NOTE: Due to the nature of make, it is important that you put the trailing slash on your DESTDIR. <i>~/tmp/</i> not <i>~/tmp</i>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="DIR">DIR</dt>
<dd>

<p>Ref to array of subdirectories containing Makefile.PLs e.g. [&#39;sdbm&#39;] in ext/SDBM_File</p>

</dd>
<dt id="DISTNAME">DISTNAME</dt>
<dd>

<p>A safe filename for the package.</p>

<p>Defaults to NAME below but with :: replaced with -.</p>

<p>For example, Foo::Bar becomes Foo-Bar.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="DISTVNAME">DISTVNAME</dt>
<dd>

<p>Your name for distributing the package with the version number included. This is used by &#39;make dist&#39; to name the resulting archive file.</p>

<p>Defaults to DISTNAME-VERSION.</p>

<p>For example, version 1.04 of Foo::Bar becomes Foo-Bar-1.04.</p>

<p>On some OS&#39;s where . has special meaning VERSION_SYM may be used in place of VERSION.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="DLEXT">DLEXT</dt>
<dd>

<p>Specifies the extension of the module&#39;s loadable object. For example:</p>

<pre><code>  DLEXT =&gt; &#39;unusual_ext&#39;, # Default value is $Config{so}</code></pre>

<p>NOTE: When using this option to alter the extension of a module&#39;s loadable object, it is also necessary that the module&#39;s pm file specifies the same change:</p>

<pre><code>  local $DynaLoader::dl_dlext = &#39;unusual_ext&#39;;</code></pre>

</dd>
<dt id="DL_FUNCS">DL_FUNCS</dt>
<dd>

<p>Hashref of symbol names for routines to be made available as universal symbols. Each key/value pair consists of the package name and an array of routine names in that package. Used only under AIX, OS/2, VMS and Win32 at present. The routine names supplied will be expanded in the same way as XSUB names are expanded by the XS() macro. Defaults to</p>

<pre><code>  {&quot;$(NAME)&quot; =&gt; [&quot;boot_$(NAME)&quot; ] }</code></pre>

<p>e.g.</p>

<pre><code>  {&quot;RPC&quot; =&gt; [qw( boot_rpcb rpcb_gettime getnetconfigent )],
   &quot;NetconfigPtr&quot; =&gt; [ &#39;DESTROY&#39;] }</code></pre>

<p>Please see the <a href="/cperl/lib/ExtUtils/Mksymlists.html">ExtUtils::Mksymlists</a> documentation for more information about the DL_FUNCS, DL_VARS and FUNCLIST attributes.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="DL_VARS">DL_VARS</dt>
<dd>

<p>Array of symbol names for variables to be made available as universal symbols. Used only under AIX, OS/2, VMS and Win32 at present. Defaults to []. (e.g. [ qw(Foo_version Foo_numstreams Foo_tree ) ])</p>

</dd>
<dt id="EXCLUDE_EXT">EXCLUDE_EXT</dt>
<dd>

<p>Array of extension names to exclude when doing a static build. This is ignored if INCLUDE_EXT is present. Consult INCLUDE_EXT for more details. (e.g. [ qw( Socket POSIX ) ] )</p>

<p>This attribute may be most useful when specified as a string on the command line: perl Makefile.PL EXCLUDE_EXT=&#39;Socket Safe&#39;</p>

</dd>
<dt id="EXE_FILES">EXE_FILES</dt>
<dd>

<p>Ref to array of executable files. The files will be copied to the INST_SCRIPT directory. Make realclean will delete them from there again.</p>

<p>If your executables start with something like #!perl or #!/usr/bin/perl MakeMaker will change this to the path of the perl &#39;Makefile.PL&#39; was invoked with so the programs will be sure to run properly even if perl is not in /usr/bin/perl.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="FIRST_MAKEFILE">FIRST_MAKEFILE</dt>
<dd>

<p>The name of the Makefile to be produced. This is used for the second Makefile that will be produced for the MAP_TARGET.</p>

<p>Defaults to &#39;Makefile&#39; or &#39;Descrip.MMS&#39; on VMS.</p>

<p>Array of extension names to be included when doing a static build.

<dt id="MAKE">MAKE</dt>
<dd>

<p>Variant of make you intend to run the generated Makefile with. This parameter lets Makefile.PL know what make quirks to account for when generating the Makefile.</p>

<p>MakeMaker also honors the MAKE environment variable. This parameter takes precedence.</p>

<p>Currently the only significant values are &#39;dmake&#39; and &#39;nmake&#39; for Windows users, instructing MakeMaker to generate a Makefile in the flavour of DMake (&quot;Dennis Vadura&#39;s Make&quot;) or Microsoft NMake respectively.</p>

<p>Defaults to $Config{make}, which may go looking for a Make program in your environment.</p>

<p>How are you supposed to know what flavour of Make a Makefile has been generated for if you didn&#39;t specify a value explicitly? Search the generated Makefile for the definition of the MAKE variable, which is used to recursively invoke the Make utility. That will tell you what Make you&#39;re supposed to invoke the Makefile with.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="MAKEAPERL">MAKEAPERL</dt>

<dt id="MAKEFILE_OLD">MAKEFILE_OLD</dt>
<dd>

<p>When &#39;make clean&#39; or similar is run, the $(FIRST_MAKEFILE) will be backed up at this location.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="MAN1PODS">MAN1PODS</dt>
<dd>

<p>Hashref of pod-containing files. MakeMaker will default this to all EXE_FILES files that include POD directives. The files listed here will be converted to man pages and installed as was requested at Configure time.</p>

<p>This hash should map POD files (or scripts containing POD) to the man file names under the <code>blib/man1/</code> directory, as in the following example:</p>

<pre><code>  MAN1PODS            =&gt; {
    &#39;doc/command.pod&#39;    =&gt; &#39;blib/man1/command.1&#39;,

  }</code></pre>

</dd>
<dt id="MAN3PODS">MAN3PODS</dt>
<dd>

<p>Hashref that assigns to *.pm and *.pod files the files into which the manpages are to be written. MakeMaker parses all *.pod and *.pm files for POD directives. Files that contain POD will be the default keys of the MAN3PODS hashref. These will then be converted to man pages during <code>make</code> and will be installed during <code>make install</code>.</p>

<p>Example similar to MAN1PODS.</p>

<dt id="META_MERGE">META_MERGE</dt>
<dd>

<p>Available in version 6.46 and above.</p>

<p>A hashref of items to add to the CPAN Meta file (<i>META.yml</i> or <i>META.json</i>).</p>

<p>They differ in how they behave if they have the same key as the default metadata. META_ADD will override the default value with its own. META_MERGE will merge its value with the default.</p>

<p>Unless you want to override the defaults, prefer META_MERGE so as to get the advantage of any future defaults.</p>

<p>Where prereqs are concerned, if META_MERGE is used, prerequisites are merged with their counterpart <code>WriteMakefile()</code> argument (PREREQ_PM is merged into {prereqs}{runtime}{requires}, BUILD_REQUIRES into <code>{prereqs}{build}{requires}</code>, CONFIGURE_REQUIRES into <code>{prereqs}{configure}{requires}</code>, and TEST_REQUIRES into <code>{prereqs}{test}{requires})</code>. When prereqs are specified with META_ADD, the only prerequisites added to the file come from the metadata, not <code>WriteMakefile()</code> arguments.</p>

<p>Note that these configuration options are only used for generating <i>META.yml</i> and <i>META.json</i> -- they are NOT used for <i>MYMETA.yml</i> and <i>MYMETA.json</i>. Therefore data in these fields should NOT be used for dynamic (user-side) configuration.</p>

<p>By default CPAN Meta specification <code>1.4</code> is used. In order to use CPAN Meta specification <code>2.0</code>, indicate with <code>meta-spec</code> the version you want to use.</p>

<pre><code>  META_MERGE        =&gt; {

    &quot;meta-spec&quot; =&gt; { version =&gt; 2 },

<p><code>NAME</code> <i>must</i> be a valid Perl package name and it <i>must</i> have an associated <code>.pm</code> file. For example, <code>Foo::Bar</code> is a valid <code>NAME</code> and there must exist <i>Foo/Bar.pm</i>. Any XS code should be in <i>Bar.xs</i> unless stated otherwise.</p>

<dt id="PERL_MALLOC_OK">PERL_MALLOC_OK</dt>

<p><b>NOTE.</b> Neglecting to set this flag in <i>any one</i> of the loaded extension nullifies many advantages of Perl&#39;s malloc(), such as better usage of system resources, error detection, memory usage reporting, catchable failure of memory allocations, etc.</p>

<dt id="PL_FILES">PL_FILES</dt>
<dd>

<p>MakeMaker can run programs to generate files for you at build time. By default any file named *.PL (except Makefile.PL and Build.PL) in the top level directory will be assumed to be a Perl program and run passing its own basename in as an argument. For example...</p>

<pre><code>    perl foo.PL foo</code></pre>

<p>This behavior can be overridden by supplying your own set of files to search. PL_FILES accepts a hash ref, the key being the file to run and the value is passed in as the first argument when the PL file is run.</p>

<pre><code>    PL_FILES =&gt; {&#39;bin/foobar.PL&#39; =&gt; &#39;bin/foobar&#39;}</code></pre>

<p>Would run bin/foobar.PL like this:</p>

<pre><code>    perl bin/foobar.PL bin/foobar</code></pre>

<p>If multiple files from one program are desired an array ref can be used.</p>

<pre><code>    PL_FILES =&gt; {&#39;bin/foobar.PL&#39; =&gt; [qw(bin/foobar1 bin/foobar2)]}</code></pre>

<p>In this case the program will be run multiple times using each target file.</p>

<pre><code>    perl bin/foobar.PL bin/foobar1
    perl bin/foobar.PL bin/foobar2</code></pre>

<p>PL files are normally run <b>after</b> pm_to_blib and include INST_LIB and INST_ARCH in their <code>@INC</code>, so the just built modules can be accessed... unless the PL file is making a module (or anything else in PM) in which case it is run <b>before</b> pm_to_blib and does not include INST_LIB and INST_ARCH in its <code>@INC</code>. This apparently odd behavior is there for backwards compatibility (and it&#39;s somewhat DWIM).</p>

</dd>
<dt id="PM">PM</dt>
<dd>

<p>Hashref of .pm files and *.pl files to be installed. e.g.</p>

<pre><code>  {&#39;name_of_file.pm&#39; =&gt; &#39;$(INST_LIB)/install_as.pm&#39;}</code></pre>

<p>By default this will include *.pm and *.pl and the files found in the PMLIBDIRS directories. Defining PM in the Makefile.PL will override PMLIBDIRS.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="PMLIBDIRS">PMLIBDIRS</dt>
<dd>

<p>Ref to array of subdirectories containing library files. Defaults to [ &#39;lib&#39;, $(BASEEXT) ]. The directories will be scanned and <i>any</i> files they contain will be installed in the corresponding location in the library. A libscan() method can be used to alter the behaviour. Defining PM in the Makefile.PL will override PMLIBDIRS.</p>

<p>(Where BASEEXT is the last component of NAME.)</p>

</dd>
<dt id="PM_FILTER">PM_FILTER</dt>
<dd>

<p>A filter program, in the traditional Unix sense (input from stdin, output to stdout) that is passed on each .pm file during the build (in the pm_to_blib() phase). It is empty by default, meaning no filtering is done.</p>

<p>Great care is necessary when defining the command if quoting needs to be done. For instance, you would need to say:</p>

<pre><code>  {&#39;PM_FILTER&#39; =&gt; &#39;grep -v \\&quot;^\\#\\&quot;&#39;}</code></pre>

<p>to remove all the leading comments on the fly during the build. The extra \\ are necessary, unfortunately, because this variable is interpolated within the context of a Perl program built on the command line, and double quotes are what is used with the -e switch to build that command line. The # is escaped for the Makefile, since what is going to be generated will then be:</p>

<pre><code>  PM_FILTER = grep -v \&quot;^\#\&quot;</code></pre>

<p>Without the \\ before the #, we&#39;d have the start of a Makefile comment, and the macro would be incorrectly defined.</p>

<p>This overrides all the default install locations. Man pages, libraries, scripts, etc... MakeMaker will try to make an educated guess about where to place things under the new PREFIX based on your Config defaults.

<dt id="PREREQ_FATAL">PREREQ_FATAL</dt>
<dd>

<p>Bool. If this parameter is true, failing to have the required modules (or the right versions thereof) will be fatal. <code>perl Makefile.PL</code> will <code>die</code> instead of simply informing the user of the missing dependencies.</p>

<p>It is <i>extremely</i> rare to have to use <code>PREREQ_FATAL</code>. Its use by module authors is <i>strongly discouraged</i> and should never be used lightly.</p>

<p>For dependencies that are required in order to run <code>Makefile.PL</code>, see <code>CONFIGURE_REQUIRES</code>.</p>

<p>Module installation tools have ways of resolving unmet dependencies but to do that they need a <i>Makefile</i>. Using <code>PREREQ_FATAL</code> breaks this. That&#39;s bad.</p>

<p>Assuming you have good test coverage, your tests should fail with missing dependencies informing the user more strongly that something is wrong. You can write a <i>t/00compile.t</i> test which will simply check that your code compiles and stop &quot;make test&quot; prematurely if it doesn&#39;t. See <a href="/cperl/lib/Test/More.html#BAIL_OUT">&quot;BAIL_OUT&quot; in Test::More</a> for more details.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="VERSION_FROM">VERSION_FROM</dt>
<dd>

<p>Instead of specifying the VERSION in the Makefile.PL you can let MakeMaker parse a file to determine the version number. The parsing routine requires that the file named by VERSION_FROM contains one single line to compute the version number. The first line in the file that contains something like a $VERSION assignment or <code>package Name VERSION</code> will be used. The following lines will be parsed o.k.:</p>

<pre><code>    # Good
    package Foo::Bar 1.23;                      # 1.23
    $VERSION   = &#39;1.00&#39;;                        # 1.00
    *VERSION   = \&#39;1.01&#39;;                       # 1.01
    ($VERSION) = q$Revision$ =~ /(\d+)/g;       # The digits in $Revision$
    $FOO::VERSION = &#39;1.10&#39;;                     # 1.10
    *FOO::VERSION = \&#39;1.11&#39;;                    # 1.11</code></pre>

<p>but these will fail:</p>

<pre><code>    # Bad
    my $VERSION         = &#39;1.01&#39;;
    local $VERSION      = &#39;1.02&#39;;
    local $FOO::VERSION = &#39;1.30&#39;;</code></pre>

<p>(Putting <code>my</code> or <code>local</code> on the preceding line will work o.k.)</p>

<p>&quot;Version strings&quot; are incompatible and should not be used.</p>

<pre><code>    # Bad
    $VERSION = 1.2.3;
    $VERSION = v1.2.3;</code></pre>

<p><a href="/cperl/lib/version.html">version</a> objects are fine. As of MakeMaker 6.35 version.pm will be automatically loaded, but you must declare the dependency on version.pm. For compatibility with older MakeMaker you should load on the same line as $VERSION is declared.</p>

<pre><code>    # All on one line
    use version; our $VERSION = qv(1.2.3);</code></pre>

<p>The file named in VERSION_FROM is not added as a dependency to Makefile. This is not really correct, but it would be a major pain during development to have to rewrite the Makefile for any smallish change in that file. If you want to make sure that the Makefile contains the correct VERSION macro after any change of the file, you would have to do something like</p>

<pre><code>    depend =&gt; { Makefile =&gt; &#39;$(VERSION_FROM)&#39; }</code></pre>

<h2 id="Overriding-MakeMaker-Methods">Overriding MakeMaker Methods</h2>

<p>If you cannot achieve the desired Makefile behaviour by specifying attributes you may define private subroutines in the Makefile.PL. Each subroutine returns the text it wishes to have written to the Makefile. To override a section of the Makefile you can either say:</p>

<pre><code>        sub MY::c_o { &quot;new literal text&quot; }</code></pre>

<p>or you can edit the default by saying something like:</p>

<pre><code>        package MY; # so that &quot;SUPER&quot; works right
        sub c_o {
            my $inherited = shift-&gt;SUPER::c_o(@_);
            $inherited =~ s/old text/new text/;
            $inherited;
        }</code></pre>

<p>If you are running experiments with embedding perl as a library into other applications, you might find MakeMaker is not sufficient. You&#39;d better have a look at ExtUtils::Embed which is a collection of utilities for embedding.</p>

<p>If you still need a different solution, try to develop another subroutine that fits your needs and submit the diffs to <code>makemaker@perl.org</code></p>

<p>For a complete description of all MakeMaker methods see <a href="/cperl/lib/ExtUtils/MM_Unix.html">ExtUtils::MM_Unix</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a simple example of how to add a new target to the generated Makefile:</p>

<pre><code>    sub MY::postamble {
        return &lt;&lt;&#39;MAKE_FRAG&#39;;
    $(MYEXTLIB): sdbm/Makefile
            cd sdbm &amp;&amp; $(MAKE) all

    MAKE_FRAG
    }</code></pre>

<h2 id="The-End-Of-Cargo-Cult-Programming">The End Of Cargo Cult Programming</h2>

<p>WriteMakefile() now does some basic sanity checks on its parameters to protect against typos and malformatted values. This means some things which happened to work in the past will now throw warnings and possibly produce internal errors.</p>

<p>Some of the most common mistakes:</p>

<dl>

<dt id="MAN3PODS1"><code>MAN3PODS =&gt; &#39; &#39;</code></dt>
<dd>

<p>This is commonly used to suppress the creation of man pages. MAN3PODS takes a hash ref not a string, but the above worked by accident in old versions of MakeMaker.</p>

<p>The correct code is <code>MAN3PODS =&gt; { }</code>.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="Hintsfile-support">Hintsfile support</h2>

<p>MakeMaker.pm uses the architecture-specific information from Config.pm. In addition it evaluates architecture specific hints files in a <code>hints/</code> directory. The hints files are expected to be named like their counterparts in <code>PERL_SRC/hints</code>, but with an <code>.pl</code> file name extension (eg. <code>next_3_2.pl</code>). They are simply <code>eval</code>ed by MakeMaker within the WriteMakefile() subroutine, and can be used to execute commands as well as to include special variables. The rules which hintsfile is chosen are the same as in Configure.</p>

<p>The hintsfile is eval()ed immediately after the arguments given to WriteMakefile are stuffed into a hash reference $self but before this reference becomes blessed. So if you want to do the equivalent to override or create an attribute you would say something like</p>

<pre><code>    $self-&gt;{LIBS} = [&#39;-ldbm -lucb -lc&#39;];</code></pre>

<h2 id="Distribution-Support">Distribution Support</h2>

<p>reports which files are skipped due to the entries in the <code>MANIFEST.SKIP</code> file (See ExtUtils::Manifest::skipcheck() for details)</p>

</dd>
<dt id="make-distclean">make distclean</dt>

</dd>
<dt id="make-veryclean">make veryclean</dt>
<dd>

<p>does a realclean first and then removes backup files such as <code>*~</code>, <code>*.bak</code>, <code>*.old</code> and <code>*.orig</code></p>

</dd>
<dt id="make-manifest">make manifest</dt>
<dd>

<p>rewrites the MANIFEST file, adding all remaining files found (See ExtUtils::Manifest::mkmanifest() for details)</p>

</dd>
<dt id="make-distdir">make distdir</dt>
<dd>

<p>Copies all the files that are in the MANIFEST file to a newly created directory with the name <code>$(DISTNAME)-$(VERSION)</code>. If that directory exists, it will be removed first.</p>

<p>Additionally, it will create META.yml and META.json module meta-data file in the distdir and add this to the distdir&#39;s MANIFEST. You can shut this behavior off with the NO_META flag.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="make-disttest">make disttest</dt>

<p>First does a distdir. Then a command $(PREOP) which defaults to a null command. Next it runs <code>shar</code> on that directory into a sharfile and deletes the intermediate directory again. Finishes with a command $(POSTOP) which defaults to a null command. Note: For shdist to work properly a <code>shar</code> program that can handle directories is mandatory.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="make-zipdist">make zipdist</dt>
<dd>

<p>First does a distdir. Then a command $(PREOP) which defaults to a null command. Runs <code>$(ZIP) $(ZIPFLAGS)</code> on that directory into a zipfile. Then deletes that directory. Finishes with a command $(POSTOP) which defaults to a null command.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="make-ci">make ci</dt>
<dd>

<p>Does a $(CI) and a $(RCS_LABEL) on all files in the MANIFEST file.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<p>Customization of the dist targets can be done by specifying a hash reference to the dist attribute of the WriteMakefile call. The following parameters are recognized:</p>

<pre><code>    CI           (&#39;ci -u&#39;)
    COMPRESS     (&#39;gzip --best&#39;)
    POSTOP       (&#39;@ :&#39;)

<h2 id="Module-Meta-Data-META-and-MYMETA">Module Meta-Data (META and MYMETA)</h2>

<p>Long plaguing users of MakeMaker based modules has been the problem of getting basic information about the module out of the sources <i>without</i> running the <i>Makefile.PL</i> and doing a bunch of messy heuristics on the resulting <i>Makefile</i>. Over the years, it has become standard to keep this information in one or more CPAN Meta files distributed with each distribution.</p>

<p>The original format of CPAN Meta files was <a href="/cperl/lib/CPAN/Meta/YAML.html">YAML</a> and the corresponding file was called <i>META.yml</i>. In 2010, version 2 of the <a href="/cperl/lib/CPAN/Meta/Spec.html">CPAN::Meta::Spec</a> was released, which mandates JSON format for the metadata in order to overcome certain compatibility issues between YAML serializers and to avoid breaking older clients unable to handle a new version of the spec. The <a href="/cperl/lib/CPAN/Meta.html">CPAN::Meta</a> library is now standard for accessing old and new-style Meta files.</p>

<p>If <a href="/cperl/lib/CPAN/Meta.html">CPAN::Meta</a> is installed, MakeMaker will automatically generate <i>META.json</i> and <i>META.yml</i> files for you and add them to your <i>MANIFEST</i> as part of the &#39;distdir&#39; target (and thus the &#39;dist&#39; target). This is intended to seamlessly and rapidly populate CPAN with module meta-data. If you wish to shut this feature off, set the <code>NO_META</code> <code>WriteMakefile()</code> flag to true.</p>

<p>At the 2008 QA Hackathon in Oslo, Perl module toolchain maintainers agrees to use the CPAN Meta format to communicate post-configuration requirements between toolchain components. These files, <i>MYMETA.json</i> and <i>MYMETA.yml</i>, are generated when <i>Makefile.PL</i> generates a <i>Makefile</i> (if <a href="/cperl/lib/CPAN/Meta.html">CPAN::Meta</a> is installed). Clients like <a href="/cperl/lib/CPAN.html">CPAN</a> or <a>CPANPLUS</a> will read this files to see what prerequisites must be fulfilled before building or testing the distribution. If you with to shut this feature off, set the <code>NO_MYMETA</code> <code>WriteMakeFile()</code> flag to true.</p>

<h2 id="Disabling-an-extension">Disabling an extension</h2>

<p>If some events detected in <i>Makefile.PL</i> imply that there is no way to create the Module, but this is a normal state of things, then you can create a <i>Makefile</i> which does nothing, but succeeds on all the &quot;usual&quot; build targets. To do so, use</p>

<pre><code>    use ExtUtils::MakeMaker qw(WriteEmptyMakefile);
    WriteEmptyMakefile();</code></pre>

<p>instead of WriteMakefile().</p>

<p>This may be useful if other modules expect this module to be <i>built</i> OK, as opposed to <i>work</i> OK (say, this system-dependent module builds in a subdirectory of some other distribution, or is listed as a dependency in a CPAN::Bundle, but the functionality is supported by different means on the current architecture).</p>

<p>If <code>prompt()</code> detects that it is not running interactively and there is nothing on STDIN or if the PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT environment variable is set to true, the $default will be used without prompting. This prevents automated processes from blocking on user input.</p>

<pre><code>  PERL_MM_OPT=&#39;CCFLAGS=&quot;-Wl,-rpath -Wl,/foo/bar/lib&quot; LIBS=&quot;-lwibble -lwobble&quot;&#39;</code></pre>

</dd>
<dt id="PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT">PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT</dt>
<dd>

<p>If set to a true value then MakeMaker&#39;s prompt function will always return the default without waiting for user input.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="PERL_CORE1">PERL_CORE</dt>
<dd>

<p>Same as the PERL_CORE parameter. The parameter overrides this.</p>

<p><a>Module::Build</a> is a pure-Perl alternative to MakeMaker which does not rely on make or any other external utility. It is easier to extend to suit your needs.</p>

<p><a>Module::Install</a> is a wrapper around MakeMaker which adds features not normally available.</p>

<p><a>ExtUtils::ModuleMaker</a> and <a>Module::Starter</a> are both modules to help you setup your distribution.</p>

<p><a href="/cperl/lib/CPAN/Meta.html">CPAN::Meta</a> and <a href="/cperl/lib/CPAN/Meta/Spec.html">CPAN::Meta::Spec</a> explain CPAN Meta files in detail.</p>

<p><a>File::ShareDir::Install</a> makes it easy to install static, sometimes also referred to as &#39;shared&#39; files. <a>File::ShareDir</a> helps accessing the shared files after installation.</p>

<p><a>Dist::Zilla</a> makes it easy for the module author to create MakeMaker-based distributions with lots of bells and whistles.</p>
