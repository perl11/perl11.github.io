<h1 id="NAME">NAME</h1>

<p>B::Terse - Walk Perl syntax tree, printing terse info about ops</p>

<h1 id="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</h1>

<pre><code>        perl -MO=Terse[,OPTIONS] foo.pl</code></pre>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>This module prints the contents of the parse tree, but without as much information as <a href="/cperl/lib/B/Debug.html">B::Debug</a>. For comparison, <code>print &quot;Hello, world.&quot;</code> produced 96 lines of output from B::Debug, but only 6 from B::Terse.</p>

<p>This module is useful for people who are writing their own back end, or who are learning about the Perl internals. It&#39;s not useful to the average programmer.</p>

<p>This version of B::Terse is really just a wrapper that calls <a href="/cperl/lib/B/Concise.html">B::Concise</a> with the <b>-terse</b> option. It is provided for compatibility with old scripts (and habits) but using B::Concise directly is now recommended instead.</p>

<p>For compatibility with the old B::Terse, this module also adds a method named <code>terse</code> to B::OP and B::SV objects. The B::SV method is largely compatible with the old one, though authors of new software might be advised to choose a more user-friendly output format. The B::OP <code>terse</code> method, however, doesn&#39;t work well. Since B::Terse was first written, much more information in OPs has migrated to the scratchpad datastructure, but the <code>terse</code> interface doesn&#39;t have any way of getting to the correct pad. As a kludge, the new version will always use the pad for the main program, but for OPs in subroutines this will give the wrong answer or crash.</p>

<h1 id="AUTHOR">AUTHOR</h1>

<p>The original version of B::Terse was written by Malcolm Beattie, &lt;mbeattie@sable.ox.ac.uk&gt;. This wrapper was written by Stephen McCamant, &lt;smcc@MIT.EDU&gt;.</p>
