<p>perlhurd - Perl version 5 on Hurd</p>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>If you want to use Perl on the Hurd, I recommend using the Debian GNU/Hurd distribution ( see <a href="http://www.debian.org/">http://www.debian.org/</a> ), even if an official, stable release has not yet been made. The old &quot;gnu-0.2&quot; binary distribution will most certainly have additional problems.</p>

<h2 id="Known-Problems-with-Perl-on-Hurd">Known Problems with Perl on Hurd</h2>

<p>The Perl test suite may still report some errors on the Hurd. The &quot;lib/anydbm&quot; and &quot;pragma/warnings&quot; tests will almost certainly fail. Both failures are not really specific to the Hurd, as indicated by the test suite output.</p>

<p>The socket tests may fail if the network is not configured. You have to make &quot;/hurd/pfinet&quot; the translator for &quot;/servers/socket/2&quot;, giving it the right arguments. Try &quot;/hurd/pfinet --help&quot; for more information.</p>

<p>Here are the statistics for Perl 5.005_62 on my system:</p>

<pre><code> Failed Test  Status Wstat Total Fail  Failed  List of failed
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 lib/anydbm.t                 12    1   8.33%  12
 pragma/warnings             333    1   0.30%  215

 8 tests and 24 subtests skipped.
 Failed 2/229 test scripts, 99.13% okay. 2/10850 subtests failed,
     99.98% okay.</code></pre>

<p>There are quite a few systems out there that do worse!</p>

<p>However, since I am running a very recent Hurd snapshot, in which a lot of bugs that were exposed by the Perl test suite have been fixed, you may encounter more failures. Likely candidates are: &quot;op/stat&quot;, &quot;lib/io_pipe&quot;, &quot;lib/io_sock&quot;, &quot;lib/io_udp&quot; and &quot;lib/time&quot;.</p>

<p>In any way, if you&#39;re seeing failures beyond those mentioned in this document, please consider upgrading to the latest Hurd before reporting the failure as a bug.</p>
