<p>perl5162delta - what is new for perl v5.16.2</p>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>This document describes differences between the 5.16.1 release and the 5.16.2 release.</p>

<p>If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.16.0, first read <a href="/cperl/perl5161delta.html">perl5161delta</a>, which describes differences between 5.16.0 and 5.16.1.</p>

<h1 id="Incompatible-Changes">Incompatible Changes</h1>

<p>There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.16.0 If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a report. See <a href="#Reporting-Bugs">&quot;Reporting Bugs&quot;</a> below.</p>

<ul>

<li><p><a href="/cperl/lib/Module/CoreList.html">Module::CoreList</a> has been upgraded from version 2.70 to version 2.76.</p>

</ul>

<li><p>configuration should no longer be confused by ls colorization</p>

<dl>

<dt id="AIX">AIX</dt>
<dd>

<p>Configure now always adds -qlanglvl=extc99 to the CC flags on AIX when using xlC. This will make it easier to compile a number of XS-based modules that assume C99 [perl #113778].</p>

</dd>

<h1 id="Selected-Bug-Fixes">Selected Bug Fixes</h1>

<ul>

<li><p>fix /\h/ equivalence with /[\h]/</p>

<p>see [perl #114220]</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="Known-Problems">Known Problems</h1>

<p>There are no new known problems.</p>

<h1 id="Acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h1>

<p>Perl 5.16.2 represents approximately 2 months of development since Perl 5.16.1 and contains approximately 740 lines of changes across 20 files from 9 authors.</p>

<p>Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant community of users and developers. The following people are known to have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.16.2:</p>

<p>Andy Dougherty, Craig A. Berry, Darin McBride, Dominic Hargreaves, Karen Etheridge, Karl Williamson, Peter Martini, Ricardo Signes, Tony Cook.</p>

<p>The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated from version control history. In particular, it does not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.</p>

<p>For a more complete list of all of Perl&#39;s historical contributors, please see the <i>AUTHORS</i> file in the Perl source distribution.</p>

<h1 id="Reporting-Bugs">Reporting Bugs</h1>

<p>If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . There may also be information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.</p>

<p>If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the <a>perlbug</a> program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of <code>perl -V</code>, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.</p>

<p>If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.</p>
