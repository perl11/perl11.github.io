<p>perldiag - various Perl diagnostics</p>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>These messages are classified as follows (listed in increasing order of desperation):</p>

<pre><code>    (W) A warning (optional).
    (D) A deprecation (enabled by default).
    (S) A severe warning (enabled by default).
    (F) A fatal error (trappable).
    (P) An internal error you should never see (trappable).
    (X) A very fatal error (nontrappable).
    (A) An alien error message (not generated by Perl).</code></pre>

<p>The majority of messages from the first three classifications above (W, D &amp; S) can be controlled using the <code>warnings</code> pragma.</p>

<p>If a message can be controlled by the <code>warnings</code> pragma, its warning category is included with the classification letter in the description below. E.g. <code>(W closed)</code> means a warning in the <code>closed</code> category.</p>

<p>Optional warnings are enabled by using the <code>warnings</code> pragma or the <b>-w</b> and <b>-W</b> switches. Warnings may be captured by setting <code>$SIG{__WARN__}</code> to a reference to a routine that will be called on each warning instead of printing it. See <a href="/cperl/perlvar.html">perlvar</a>.</p>

<p>Severe warnings are always enabled, unless they are explicitly disabled with the <code>warnings</code> pragma or the <b>-X</b> switch.</p>

<p>Trappable errors may be trapped using the eval operator. See <a href="/cperl/perlfunc.html#eval">&quot;eval&quot; in perlfunc</a>. In almost all cases, warnings may be selectively disabled or promoted to fatal errors using the <code>warnings</code> pragma. See <a href="/cperl/lib/warnings.html">warnings</a>.</p>

<p>The messages are in alphabetical order, without regard to upper or lower-case. Some of these messages are generic. Spots that vary are denoted with a %s or other printf-style escape. These escapes are ignored by the alphabetical order, as are all characters other than letters. To look up your message, just ignore anything that is not a letter.</p>

<p>Specially handled security warnings are listed as <b>(S security)</b>.</p>

<dl>

<dt id="accept-on-closed-socket-s">accept() on closed socket %s</dt>
<dd>

<p>(W closed) You tried to do an accept on a closed socket. Did you forget to check the return value of your socket() call? See <a href="/cperl/perlfunc.html#accept">&quot;accept&quot; in perlfunc</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Aliasing-via-reference-is-experimental">Aliasing via reference is experimental</dt>
<dd>

<p>(S experimental::refaliasing) This warning is emitted if you use a reference constructor on the left-hand side of an assignment to alias one variable to another. Simply suppress the warning if you want to use the feature, but know that in doing so you are taking the risk of using an experimental feature which may change or be removed in a future Perl version:</p>

<pre><code>    no warnings &quot;experimental::refaliasing&quot;;
    use feature &quot;refaliasing&quot;;
    \$x = \$y;</code></pre>

</dd>
<dt id="Allocation-too-large:-x">Allocation too large: %x</dt>
<dd>

<p>(X) You can&#39;t allocate more than 64K on an MS-DOS machine.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="c-allowed-only-after-types-s-in-s">&#39;%c&#39; allowed only after types %s in %s</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) The modifiers &#39;!&#39;, &#39;&lt;&#39; and &#39;&gt;&#39; are allowed in pack() or unpack() only after certain types. See <a href="/cperl/perlfunc.html#pack">&quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="alpha-numify-is-lossy">alpha-&gt;numify() is lossy</dt>
<dd>

<p>(W numeric) An alpha version can not be numified without losing information.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Ambiguous-call-resolved-as-CORE::-s-qualify-as-such-or-use">Ambiguous call resolved as CORE::%s(), qualify as such or use &amp;</dt>
<dd>

<p>(W ambiguous) A subroutine you have declared has the same name as a Perl keyword, and you have used the name without qualification for calling one or the other. Perl decided to call the builtin because the subroutine is not imported.</p>

<p>To force interpretation as a subroutine call, either put an ampersand before the subroutine name, or qualify the name with its package. Alternatively, you can import the subroutine (or pretend that it&#39;s imported with the <code>use subs</code> pragma).</p>

<p>To silently interpret it as the Perl operator, use the <code>CORE::</code> prefix on the operator (e.g. <code>CORE::log($x)</code>) or declare the subroutine to be an object method (see <a href="/cperl/perlsub.html#Subroutine-Attributes">&quot;Subroutine Attributes&quot; in perlsub</a> or <a href="/cperl/lib/attributes.html">attributes</a>).</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Ambiguous-range-in-transliteration-operator">Ambiguous range in transliteration operator</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) You wrote something like <code>tr/a-z-0//</code> which doesn&#39;t mean anything at all. To include a <code>-</code> character in a transliteration, put it either first or last. (In the past, <code>tr/a-z-0//</code> was synonymous with <code>tr/a-y//</code>, which was probably not what you would have expected.)</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Ambiguous-use-of-s-resolved-as-s">Ambiguous use of %s resolved as %s</dt>
<dd>

<p>(S ambiguous) You said something that may not be interpreted the way you thought. Normally it&#39;s pretty easy to disambiguate it by supplying a missing quote, operator, parenthesis pair or declaration.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Ambiguous-use-of---s-resolved-as---s">Ambiguous use of -%s resolved as -&amp;%s()</dt>
<dd>

<p>(S ambiguous) You wrote something like <code>-foo</code>, which might be the string <code>&quot;-foo&quot;</code>, or a call to the function <code>foo</code>, negated. If you meant the string, just write <code>&quot;-foo&quot;</code>. If you meant the function call, write <code>-foo()</code>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Ambiguous-use-of-c-resolved-as-operator-c">Ambiguous use of %c resolved as operator %c</dt>
<dd>

<p>(S ambiguous) <code>%</code>, <code>&amp;</code>, and <code>*</code> are both infix operators (modulus, bitwise and, and multiplication) <i>and</i> initial special characters (denoting hashes, subroutines and typeglobs), and you said something like <code>*foo * foo</code> that might be interpreted as either of them. We assumed you meant the infix operator, but please try to make it more clear -- in the example given, you might write <code>*foo * foo()</code> if you really meant to multiply a glob by the result of calling a function.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Ambiguous-use-of-c-s-resolved-to-c-s">Ambiguous use of %c{%s} resolved to %c%s</dt>
<dd>

<p>(W ambiguous) You wrote something like <code>@{foo}</code>, which might be asking for the variable <code>@foo</code>, or it might be calling a function named foo, and dereferencing it as an array reference. If you wanted the variable, you can just write <code>@foo</code>. If you wanted to call the function, write <code>@{foo()}</code> ... or you could just not have a variable and a function with the same name, and save yourself a lot of trouble.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Ambiguous-use-of-c-s-...-resolved-to-c-s">Ambiguous use of %c{%s[...]} resolved to %c%s[...]</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt id="Ambiguous-use-of-c-s-...-resolved-to-c-s1">Ambiguous use of %c{%s{...}} resolved to %c%s{...}</dt>
<dd>

<p>(W ambiguous) You wrote something like <code>${foo[2]}</code> (where foo represents the name of a Perl keyword), which might be looking for element number 2 of the array named <code>@foo</code>, in which case please write <code>$foo[2]</code>, or you might have meant to pass an anonymous arrayref to the function named foo, and then do a scalar deref on the value it returns. If you meant that, write <code>${foo([2])}</code>.</p>

<p>In regular expressions, the <code>${foo[2]}</code> syntax is sometimes necessary to disambiguate between array subscripts and character classes. <code>/$length[2345]/</code>, for instance, will be interpreted as <code>$length</code> followed by the character class <code>[2345]</code>. If an array subscript is what you want, you can avoid the warning by changing <code>/${length[2345]}/</code> to the unsightly <code>/${\$length[2345]}/</code>, by renaming your array to something that does not coincide with a built-in keyword, or by simply turning off warnings with <code>no warnings &#39;ambiguous&#39;;</code>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="and-may-not-both-be-specified-on-command-line">&#39;|&#39; and &#39;&lt;&#39; may not both be specified on command line</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl does its own command line redirection, and found that STDIN was a pipe, and that you also tried to redirect STDIN using &#39;&lt;&#39;. Only one STDIN stream to a customer, please.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="and-may-not-both-be-specified-on-command-line1">&#39;|&#39; and &#39;&gt;&#39; may not both be specified on command line</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl does its own command line redirection, and thinks you tried to redirect stdout both to a file and into a pipe to another command. You need to choose one or the other, though nothing&#39;s stopping you from piping into a program or Perl script which &#39;splits&#39; output into two streams, such as</p>

<pre><code>    open(OUT,&quot;&gt;$ARGV[0]&quot;) or die &quot;Can&#39;t write to $ARGV[0]: $!&quot;;
    while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) {
        print;
        print OUT;
    }
    close OUT;</code></pre>

</dd>
<dt id="An-extern-sub-may-not-have-a-prototype">An extern sub may not have a prototype</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) With an extern sub the prototype slot is reserved for the :symbol() name, the name of the resolved sub in the external C library. The extern sub parsing is solely defined via its signature. (cperl only)</p>

<p>Note that this error message could also appear with two :symbol() declarations for one subroutine.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Applying-s-to-s-will-act-on-scalar-s">Applying %s to %s will act on scalar(%s)</dt>
<dd>

<p>(W misc) The pattern match (<code>//</code>), substitution (<code>s///</code>), and transliteration (<code>tr///</code>) operators work on scalar values. If you apply one of them to an array or a hash, it will convert the array or hash to a scalar value (the length of an array, or the population info of a hash) and then work on that scalar value. This is probably not what you meant to do. See <a href="/cperl/perlfunc.html#grep">&quot;grep&quot; in perlfunc</a> and <a href="/cperl/perlfunc.html#map">&quot;map&quot; in perlfunc</a> for alternatives.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Arg-too-short-for-msgsnd">Arg too short for msgsnd</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) msgsnd() requires a string at least as long as sizeof(long).</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Argument-s-isnt-numeric-s">Argument &quot;%s&quot; isn&#39;t numeric%s</dt>
<dd>

<p>(W numeric) The indicated string was fed as an argument to an operator that expected a numeric value instead. If you&#39;re fortunate the message will identify which operator was so unfortunate.</p>

<p>Note that for the <code>Inf</code> and <code>NaN</code> (infinity and not-a-number) the definition of &quot;numeric&quot; is somewhat unusual: the strings themselves (like &quot;Inf&quot;) are considered numeric, and anything following them is considered non-numeric.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Argument-list-not-closed-for-PerlIO-layer-s">Argument list not closed for PerlIO layer &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
<dd>

<p>(W layer) When pushing a layer with arguments onto the Perl I/O system you forgot the ) that closes the argument list. (Layers take care of transforming data between external and internal representations.) Perl stopped parsing the layer list at this point and did not attempt to push this layer. If your program didn&#39;t explicitly request the failing operation, it may be the result of the value of the environment variable PERLIO.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Argument-s-treated-as-0-in-increment">Argument &quot;%s&quot; treated as 0 in increment (++)</dt>
<dd>

<p>(W numeric) The indicated string was fed as an argument to the <code>++</code> operator which expects either a number or a string matching <code>/^[a-zA-Z]*[0-9]*\z/</code>. See <a href="/cperl/perlop.html#Auto-increment-and-Auto-decrement">&quot;Auto-increment and Auto-decrement&quot; in perlop</a> for details.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Array-index-out-of-bounds-s-d">Array index out of bounds %s[%d]</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) You tried to access an invalid index of a shaped array. With constant indices this error is detected at compile-time, with variable indices at run-time. For example</p>

<pre><code>    my @a[5];
    $a[5];</code></pre>

</dd>
<dt id="Array-passed-to-stat-will-be-coerced-to-a-scalar-s">Array passed to stat will be coerced to a scalar%s</dt>
<dd>

<p>(W syntax) You called stat() on an array, but the array will be coerced to a scalar - the number of elements in the array.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="assertion-botched:-s">assertion botched: %s</dt>
<dd>

<p>(X) The malloc package that comes with Perl had an internal failure.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Assertion-s-failed:-file-s-line-d">Assertion %s failed: file &quot;%s&quot;, line %d</dt>
<dd>

<p>(X) A general assertion failed. The file in question must be examined.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Assigned-value-is-not-a-reference">Assigned value is not a reference</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) You tried to assign something that was not a reference to an lvalue reference (e.g., <code>\$x = $y</code>). If you meant to make $x an alias to $y, use <code>\$x = \$y</code>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Assigned-value-is-not-s-reference">Assigned value is not %s reference</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) You tried to assign a reference to a reference constructor, but the two references were not of the same type. You cannot alias a scalar to an array, or an array to a hash; the two types must match.</p>

<pre><code>    \$x = \@y;  # error
    \@x = \%y;  # error
     $y = [];
    \$x = $y;   # error; did you mean \$y?</code></pre>

</dd>
<dt id="Assigning-non-zero-to-is-no-longer-possible">Assigning non-zero to $[ is no longer possible</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) When the &quot;array_base&quot; feature is disabled (e.g., and under <code>use v5.16;</code>, and as of Perl 5.30) the special variable <code>$[</code>, which is deprecated, is now a fixed zero value.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Assignment-to-both-a-list-and-a-scalar">Assignment to both a list and a scalar</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) If you assign to a conditional operator, the 2nd and 3rd arguments must either both be scalars or both be lists. Otherwise Perl won&#39;t know which context to supply to the right side.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Assuming-NOT-a-POSIX-class-since-s-in-regex-marked-by----HERE-in-m-s">Assuming NOT a POSIX class since %s in regex; marked by <span style="white-space: nowrap;">&lt;-- HERE</span> in m/%s/</dt>
<dd>

<p>(W regexp) You had something like these:</p>

<pre><code> [[:alnum]]
 [[:digit:xyz]</code></pre>

<p>They look like they might have been meant to be the POSIX classes <code>[:alnum:]</code> or <code>[:digit:]</code>. If so, they should be written:</p>

<pre><code> [[:alnum:]]
 [[:digit:]xyz]</code></pre>

<p>Since these aren&#39;t legal POSIX class specifications, but are legal bracketed character classes, Perl treats them as the latter. In the first example, it matches the characters <code>&quot;:&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;[&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;a&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;l&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;m&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;n&quot;</code>, and <code>&quot;u&quot;</code>.</p>

<p>If these weren&#39;t meant to be POSIX classes, this warning message is spurious, and can be suppressed by reordering things, such as</p>

<pre><code> [[al:num]]</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code> [[:munla]]</code></pre>

</dd>
<dt id="at-require-statement-should-be-quotes">&lt;&gt; at require-statement should be quotes</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) You wrote <code>require &lt;file&gt;</code> when you should have written <code>require &#39;file&#39;</code>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Attempt-to-access-disallowed-key-s-in-a-restricted-hash">Attempt to access disallowed key &#39;%s&#39; in a restricted hash</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) The failing code has attempted to get or set a key which is not in the current set of allowed keys of a restricted hash. Check with exists first.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Attempt-to-access-disallowed-key-s-in-the-restricted-hash-s">Attempt to access disallowed key &#39;%s&#39; in the restricted hash &#39;%s&#39;</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) The failing code has attempted to get or set a key which is not in the current set of allowed keys of the restricted hash, i.e. a closed class. Check with exists first.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Attempt-to-bless-into-a-freed-package">Attempt to bless into a freed package</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) You wrote <code>bless $foo</code> with one argument after somehow causing the current package to be freed. Perl cannot figure out what to do, so it throws up its hands in despair.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Attempt-to-bless-into-a-reference">Attempt to bless into a reference</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) The CLASSNAME argument to the bless() operator is expected to be the name of the package to bless the resulting object into. You&#39;ve supplied instead a reference to something: perhaps you wrote</p>

<pre><code>    bless $self, $proto;</code></pre>

<p>when you intended</p>

<pre><code>    bless $self, ref($proto) || $proto;</code></pre>

<p>If you actually want to bless into the stringified version of the reference supplied, you need to stringify it yourself, for example by:</p>

<pre><code>    bless $self, &quot;$proto&quot;;</code></pre>

</dd>
<dt id="Attempt-to-clear-deleted-array">Attempt to clear deleted array</dt>
<dd>

<p>(S debugging) An array was assigned to when it was being freed. Freed values are not supposed to be visible to Perl code. This can also happen if XS code calls <code>av_clear</code> from a custom magic callback on the array.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Attempt-to-change-hash-while-iterating-over-it">Attempt to change hash while iterating over it</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) Either <code>use hashiter</code> to continue using destructive hash iterators with unexpected consequences, or change your code to avoid it.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Attempt-to-delete-disallowed-key-s-from-a-restricted-hash">Attempt to delete disallowed key &#39;%s&#39; from a restricted hash</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) The failing code attempted to delete from a restricted hash a key which is not in its key set.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Attempt-to-delete-readonly-key-s-from-a-restricted-hash">Attempt to delete readonly key &#39;%s&#39; from a restricted hash</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) The failing code attempted to delete a key whose value has been declared readonly from a restricted hash.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Attempt-to-free-non-arena-SV:-0x-x">Attempt to free non-arena SV: 0x%x</dt>
<dd>

<p>(S internal) All SV objects are supposed to be allocated from arenas that will be garbage collected on exit. An SV was discovered to be outside any of those arenas.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Attempt-to-free-nonexistent-shared-string-s-s">Attempt to free nonexistent shared string &#39;%s&#39;%s</dt>
<dd>

<p>(S internal) Perl maintains a reference-counted internal table of strings to optimize the storage and access of hash keys and other strings. This indicates someone tried to decrement the reference count of a string that can no longer be found in the table.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Attempt-to-free-temp-prematurely:-SV-0x-x">Attempt to free temp prematurely: SV 0x%x</dt>
<dd>

<p>(S debugging) Mortalized values are supposed to be freed by the free_tmps() routine. This indicates that something else is freeing the SV before the free_tmps() routine gets a chance, which means that the free_tmps() routine will be freeing an unreferenced scalar when it does try to free it.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Attempt-to-free-unreferenced-glob-pointers">Attempt to free unreferenced glob pointers</dt>
<dd>

<p>(S internal) The reference counts got screwed up on symbol aliases.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Attempt-to-free-unreferenced-scalar:-SV-0x-x">Attempt to free unreferenced scalar: SV 0x%x</dt>
<dd>

<p>(S internal) Perl went to decrement the reference count of a scalar to see if it would go to 0, and discovered that it had already gone to 0 earlier, and should have been freed, and in fact, probably was freed. This could indicate that SvREFCNT_dec() was called too many times, or that SvREFCNT_inc() was called too few times, or that the SV was mortalized when it shouldn&#39;t have been, or that memory has been corrupted.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Attempt-to-pack-pointer-to-temporary-value">Attempt to pack pointer to temporary value</dt>
<dd>

<p>(W pack) You tried to pass a temporary value (like the result of a function, or a computed expression) to the &quot;p&quot; pack() template. This means the result contains a pointer to a location that could become invalid anytime, even before the end of the current statement. Use literals or global values as arguments to the &quot;p&quot; pack() template to avoid this warning.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Attempt-to-reload-s-aborted">Attempt to reload %s aborted.</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) You tried to load a file with <code>use</code> or <code>require</code> that failed to compile once already. Perl will not try to compile this file again unless you delete its entry from %INC. See <a href="/cperl/perlfunc.html#require">&quot;require&quot; in perlfunc</a> and <a href="/cperl/perlvar.html#INC">&quot;%INC&quot; in perlvar</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Attempt-to-set-length-of-freed-array">Attempt to set length of freed array</dt>
<dd>

<p>(W misc) You tried to set the length of an array which has been freed. You can do this by storing a reference to the scalar representing the last index of an array and later assigning through that reference. For example</p>

<pre><code>    $r = do {my @a; \$#a};
    $$r = 503</code></pre>

</dd>
<dt id="Attempt-to-use-reference-as-lvalue-in-substr">Attempt to use reference as lvalue in substr</dt>
<dd>

<p>(W substr) You supplied a reference as the first argument to substr() used as an lvalue, which is pretty strange. Perhaps you forgot to dereference it first. See <a href="/cperl/perlfunc.html#substr">&quot;substr&quot; in perlfunc</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Attribute-prototype-s-discards-earlier-prototype-attribute-in-same-sub">Attribute prototype(%s) discards earlier prototype attribute in same sub</dt>
<dd>

<p>(W misc) A sub was declared as sub foo : prototype(A) : prototype(B) {}, for example. Since each sub can only have one prototype, the earlier declaration(s) are discarded while the last one is applied.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="A-variable-may-not-be-unshared">A variable may not be unshared</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) Wrong usage of the <code>:-shared</code> attribute on a variable. This error message was previously in <i>attributes.pm</i>, and is now since 5.22 in the cperl variant, as <a href="/cperl/lib/attributes.html">attributes</a> is now a builtin.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="av_reify-called-on-tied-array">av_reify called on tied array</dt>
<dd>

<p>(S debugging) This indicates that something went wrong and Perl got <i>very</i> confused about <code>@_</code> or <code>@DB::args</code> being tied.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Bad-arg-length-for-s-is-u-should-be-d">Bad arg length for %s, is %u, should be %d</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) You passed a buffer of the wrong size to one of msgctl(), semctl() or shmctl(). In C parlance, the correct sizes are, respectively, <span style="white-space: nowrap;">sizeof(struct msqid_ds *)</span>, <span style="white-space: nowrap;">sizeof(struct semid_ds *)</span>, and <span style="white-space: nowrap;">sizeof(struct shmid_ds *)</span>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Bad-evalled-substitution-pattern">Bad evalled substitution pattern</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) You&#39;ve used the <code>/e</code> switch to evaluate the replacement for a substitution, but perl found a syntax error in the code to evaluate, most likely an unexpected right brace &#39;}&#39;.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Bad-filehandle:-s">Bad filehandle: %s</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) A symbol was passed to something wanting a filehandle, but the symbol has no filehandle associated with it. Perhaps you didn&#39;t do an open(), or did it in another package.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Bad-free-ignored">Bad free() ignored</dt>
<dd>

<p>(S malloc) An internal routine called free() on something that had never been malloc()ed in the first place. Mandatory, but can be disabled by setting environment variable <code>PERL_BADFREE</code> to 0.</p>

<p>This message can be seen quite often with DB_File on systems with &quot;hard&quot; dynamic linking, like <code>AIX</code> and <code>OS/2</code>. It is a bug of <code>Berkeley DB</code> which is left unnoticed if <code>DB</code> uses <i>forgiving</i> system malloc().</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Bad-hash">Bad hash</dt>
<dd>

<p>(P) One of the internal hash routines was passed a null HV pointer.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Badly-placed-s">Badly placed ()&#39;s</dt>
<dd>

<p>(A) You&#39;ve accidentally run your script through <b>csh</b> instead of Perl. Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl yourself.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Bad-name-after-s">Bad name after %s</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) You started to name a symbol by using a package prefix, and then didn&#39;t finish the symbol. In particular, you can&#39;t interpolate outside of quotes, so</p>

<p>(W bareword) The compiler found a bareword where it expected a conditional, which often indicates that an || or &amp;&amp; was parsed as part of the last argument of the previous construct, for example:</p>

<pre><code>    open FOO || die;</code></pre>

<p>It may also indicate a misspelled constant that has been interpreted as a bareword:</p>

<pre><code>    use constant TYPO =&gt; 1;
    if (TYOP) { print &quot;foo&quot; }</code></pre>

<p>The <code>strict</code> pragma is useful in avoiding such errors.</p>

<p>(F) The bareword form of require has been invoked with a filename which could not have been generated by a valid bareword permitted by the parser.

<dt id="BEGIN-not-safe-after-errors--compilation-aborted">BEGIN not safe after errors--compilation aborted</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) Perl found a <code>BEGIN {}</code> subroutine (or a <code>use</code> directive, which implies a <code>BEGIN {}</code>) after one or more compilation errors had already occurred. Since the intended environment for the <code>BEGIN {}</code> could not be guaranteed (due to the errors), and since subsequent code likely depends on its correct operation, Perl just gave up.</p>

<p>In a bracketed character class in a regular expression pattern, you had a range which has exactly one end of it specified using <code>\N{}</code>, and the other end is specified using a non-portable mechanism. Perl treats the range as a Unicode range, that is, all the characters in it are considered to be the Unicode characters, and which may be different code points on some platforms Perl runs on. For example, <code>[\N{U+06}-\x08]</code> is treated as if you had instead said <code>[\N{U+06}-\N{U+08}]</code>, that is it matches the characters whose code points in Unicode are 6, 7, and 8. But that <code>\x08</code> might indicate that you meant something different, so the warning gets raised.</p>

<p>(W prototype) You&#39;ve called a function that has a prototype before the parser saw a definition or declaration for it, and Perl could not check that the call conforms to the prototype. You need to either add an early prototype declaration for the subroutine in question, or move the subroutine definition ahead of the call to get proper prototype checking. Alternatively, if you are certain that you&#39;re calling the function correctly, you may put an ampersand before the name to avoid the warning. See <a href="/cperl/perlsub.html">perlsub</a>.</p>

<p>(F) You manipulated Perl&#39;s symbol table directly, stored a reference in it, then tried to access that symbol via conventional Perl syntax. The access triggers Perl to autovivify that typeglob, but it there is no legal conversion from that type of reference to a typeglob.</p>

<dd>

<p>(W locale) You are 1) running under &quot;<code>use locale</code>&quot;; 2) the current locale is not a UTF-8 one; 3) you tried to do the designated case-change operation on the specified Unicode character; and 4) the result of this operation would mix Unicode and locale rules, which likely conflict. Mixing of different rule types is forbidden, so the operation was not done; instead the result is the indicated value, which is the best available that uses entirely Unicode rules. That turns out to almost always be the original character, unchanged.</p>

<p>It is generally a bad idea to mix non-UTF-8 locales and Unicode, and this issue is one of the reasons why. This warning is raised when Unicode rules would normally cause the result of this operation to contain a character that is in the range specified by the locale, 0..255, and hence is subject to the locale&#39;s rules, not Unicode&#39;s.</p>

<p>If you are using locale purely for its characteristics related to things like its numeric and time formatting (and not <code>LC_CTYPE</code>), consider using a restricted form of the locale pragma (see <a href="/cperl/perllocale.html#The-use-locale-pragma">&quot;The &quot;use locale&quot; pragma&quot; in perllocale</a>) like &quot;<span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>use locale &#39;:not_characters&#39;</code></span>&quot;.</p>

<p>Note that failed case-changing operations done as a result of case-insensitive <code>/i</code> regular expression matching will show up in this warning as having the <code>fc</code> operation (as that is what the regular expression engine calls behind the scenes.)</p>

<dt id="Cant-find-string-terminator-s-anywhere-before-EOF">Can&#39;t find string terminator %s anywhere before EOF</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) Perl strings can stretch over multiple lines. This message means that the closing delimiter was omitted. Because bracketed quotes count nesting levels, the following is missing its final parenthesis:</p>

<pre><code>    print q(The character &#39;(&#39; starts a side comment.);</code></pre>

<p>If you&#39;re getting this error from a here-document, you may have included unseen whitespace before or after your closing tag or there may not be a linebreak after it. A good programmer&#39;s editor will have a way to help you find these characters (or lack of characters). See <a href="/cperl/perlop.html">perlop</a> for the full details on here-documents.</p>

<p>(F) The named property which you specified via <code>\p</code> or <code>\P</code> is not one known to Perl. Perhaps you misspelled the name? See <a href="/cperl/perluniprops.html#Properties-accessible-through-p-and-P">&quot;Properties accessible through \p{} and \P{}&quot; in perluniprops</a> for a complete list of available official properties. If it is a <a href="/cperl/perlunicode.html#User-Defined-Character-Properties">user-defined property</a> it must have been defined by the time the regular expression is matched.</p>

<p>If you didn&#39;t mean to use a Unicode property, escape the <code>\p</code>, either by <code>\\p</code> (just the <code>\p</code>) or by <code>\Q\p</code> (the rest of the string, or until <code>\E</code>).</p>

<dt id="Cant-get-filespec---stale-stat-buffer">Can&#39;t get filespec - stale stat buffer?</dt>
<dd>

<p>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS. This arises because of the difference between access checks under VMS and under the Unix model Perl assumes. Under VMS, access checks are done by filename, rather than by bits in the stat buffer, so that ACLs and other protections can be taken into account. Unfortunately, Perl assumes that the stat buffer contains all the necessary information, and passes it, instead of the filespec, to the access-checking routine. It will try to retrieve the filespec using the device name and FID present in the stat buffer, but this works only if you haven&#39;t made a subsequent call to the CRTL stat() routine, because the device name is overwritten with each call. If this warning appears, the name lookup failed, and the access-checking routine gave up and returned FALSE, just to be conservative. (Note: The access-checking routine knows about the Perl <code>stat</code> operator and file tests, so you shouldn&#39;t ever see this warning in response to a Perl command; it arises only if some internal code takes stat buffers lightly.)</p>

<dt id="Cant-get-pipe-mailbox-device-name">Can&#39;t get pipe mailbox device name</dt>

<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS. After creating a mailbox to act as a pipe, Perl can&#39;t retrieve its name for later use.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Cant-get-SYSGEN-parameter-value-for-MAXBUF">Can&#39;t get SYSGEN parameter value for MAXBUF</dt>

<dt id="Cant-goto-into-a-binary-or-list-expression">Can&#39;t &quot;goto&quot; into a binary or list expression</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) A &quot;goto&quot; statement was executed to jump into the middle of a binary or list expression. You can&#39;t get there from here. The reason for this restriction is that the interpreter would get confused as to how many arguments there are, resulting in stack corruption or crashes. This error occurs in cases such as these:</p>

<pre><code>    goto F;
    print do { F: }; # Can&#39;t jump into the arguments to print

<p>(F) A &quot;goto&quot; statement was executed to jump out of what might look like a block, except that it isn&#39;t a proper block. This usually occurs if you tried to jump out of a sort() block or subroutine, which is a no-no. See <a href="/cperl/perlfunc.html#goto">&quot;goto&quot; in perlfunc</a>.</p>

<p>(F) The deeply magical &quot;goto subroutine&quot; call can only replace one subroutine call for another. It can&#39;t manufacture one out of whole cloth.

<dt id="Cant-ignore-signal-CHLD-forcing-to-default">Can&#39;t ignore signal CHLD, forcing to default</dt>
<dd>

<p>(W signal) Perl has detected that it is being run with the SIGCHLD signal (sometimes known as SIGCLD) disabled. Since disabling this signal will interfere with proper determination of exit status of child processes, Perl has reset the signal to its default value. This situation typically indicates that the parent program under which Perl may be running (e.g. cron) is being very careless.</p>

<p>(F) A &quot;last&quot; statement was executed to break out of the current block, except that there&#39;s this itty bitty problem called there isn&#39;t a current block. Note that an &quot;if&quot; or &quot;else&quot; block doesn&#39;t count as a &quot;loopish&quot; block, as doesn&#39;t a block given to sort(), map() or grep(). You can usually double the curlies to get the same effect though, because the inner curlies will be considered a block that loops once.

</dd>
<dt id="Cant-load-s-for-module-s">Can&#39;t load &#39;%s&#39; for module %s</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) The module you tried to load failed to load a dynamic extension. This may either mean that you upgraded your version of perl to one that is incompatible with your old dynamic extensions (which is known to happen between major versions of perl), or (more likely) that your dynamic extension was built against an older version of the library that is installed on your system. You may need to rebuild your old dynamic extensions.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Cant-localize-lexical-variable-s">Can&#39;t localize lexical variable %s</dt>

<p>(F) You used local on a variable name that was previously declared as a lexical variable using &quot;my&quot; or &quot;state&quot;. This is not allowed. If you want to localize a package variable of the same name, qualify it with the package name.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Cant-localize-through-a-reference">Can&#39;t localize through a reference</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) You said something like <code>local $$ref</code>, which Perl can&#39;t currently handle, because when it goes to restore the old value of whatever $ref pointed to after the scope of the local() is finished, it can&#39;t be sure that $ref will still be a reference.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Cant-locate-s">Can&#39;t locate %s</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) You said to <code>do</code> (or <code>require</code>, or <code>use</code>) a file that couldn&#39;t be found. Perl looks for the file in all the locations mentioned in @INC, unless the file name included the full path to the file. Perhaps you need to set the PERL5LIB or PERL5OPT environment variable to say where the extra library is, or maybe the script needs to add the library name to @INC. Or maybe you just misspelled the name of the file. See <a href="/cperl/perlfunc.html#require">&quot;require&quot; in perlfunc</a> and <a href="/cperl/lib/lib.html">lib</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Cant-locate-auto-s.al-in-INC">Can&#39;t locate auto/%s.al in @INC</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) A function (or method) was called in a package which allows autoload, but there is no function to autoload. Most probable causes are a misprint in a function/method name or a failure to <code>AutoSplit</code> the file, say, by doing <code>make install</code>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Cant-locate-loadable-object-for-module-s-in-INC">Can&#39;t locate loadable object for module %s in @INC</dt>

<dt id="Cant-make-loaded-symbols-global-on-this-platform-while-loading-s">Can&#39;t make loaded symbols global on this platform while loading %s</dt>
<dd>

<p>(S) A module passed the flag 0x01 to DynaLoader::dl_load_file() to request that symbols from the stated file are made available globally within the process, but that functionality is not available on this platform. Whilst the module likely will still work, this may prevent the perl interpreter from loading other XS-based extensions which need to link directly to functions defined in the C or XS code in the stated file.</p>

<p>(F) Assigning to <code>\local(@array)</code> or <code>\(local @array)</code> is not supported, as it is not clear exactly what it should do. If you meant to make @array refer to some other array, use <code>\@array = \@other_array</code>. If you want to make the elements of @array aliases of the scalars referenced on the right-hand side, use <code>\(@array) = @scalar_refs</code>.</p>

<p>(F) A &quot;next&quot; statement was executed to reiterate the current block, but there isn&#39;t a current block. Note that an &quot;if&quot; or &quot;else&quot; block doesn&#39;t count as a &quot;loopish&quot; block, as doesn&#39;t a block given to sort(), map() or grep(). You can usually double the curlies to get the same effect though, because the inner curlies will be considered a block that loops once.

<p>(S inplace) The implicit opening of a file through use of the <code>&lt;&gt;</code> filehandle, either implicitly under the <code>-n</code> or <code>-p</code> command-line switches, or explicitly, failed for the indicated reason. Usually this is because you don&#39;t have read permission for a file which you named on the command line.</p>

<p>(F) You tried to call perl with the <b>-e</b> switch, but <i>/dev/null</i> (or your operating system&#39;s equivalent) could not be opened.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Cant-open-a-reference">Can&#39;t open a reference</dt>

<p>(W pipe) You tried to say <code>open(CMD, &quot;|cmd|&quot;)</code>, which is not supported. You can try any of several modules in the Perl library to do this, such as IPC::Open2. Alternately, direct the pipe&#39;s output to a file using &quot;&gt;&quot;, and then read it in under a different file handle.</p>

<dd>

<p>(F) The script you specified can&#39;t be opened for the indicated reason.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re debugging a script that uses #!, and normally relies on the shell&#39;s $PATH search, the -S option causes perl to do that search, so you don&#39;t have to type the path or <code>`which $scriptname`</code>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Cant-read-CRTL-environ">Can&#39;t read CRTL environ</dt>
<dd>

<p>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS. Perl tried to read an element of %ENV from the CRTL&#39;s internal environment array and discovered the array was missing. You need to figure out where your CRTL misplaced its environ or define <i>PERL_ENV_TABLES</i> (see <a href="/cperl/perlvms.html">perlvms</a>) so that environ is not searched.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Cant-redo-outside-a-loop-block">Can&#39;t &quot;redo&quot; outside a loop block</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) A &quot;redo&quot; statement was executed to restart the current block, but there isn&#39;t a current block. Note that an &quot;if&quot; or &quot;else&quot; block doesn&#39;t count as a &quot;loopish&quot; block, as doesn&#39;t a block given to sort(), map() or grep(). You can usually double the curlies to get the same effect though, because the inner curlies will be considered a block that loops once.

</dd>
<dt id="Cant-rename-s-to-s:-s-skipping-file">Can&#39;t rename %s to %s: %s, skipping file</dt>

<p>(F) The rename done by the <b>-i</b> switch failed for some reason, probably because you don&#39;t have write permission to the directory.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Cant-reopen-input-pipe-name:-s-in-binary-mode">Can&#39;t reopen input pipe (name: %s) in binary mode</dt>

<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl thought stdin was a pipe, and tried to reopen it to accept binary data. Alas, it failed.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Cant-represent-character-for-Ox-X-on-this-platform">Can&#39;t represent character for Ox%X on this platform</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) There is a hard limit to how big a character code point can be due to the fundamental properties of UTF-8, especially on EBCDIC platforms. The given code point exceeds that. The only work-around is to not use such a large code point.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Cant-reset-ENV-on-this-system">Can&#39;t reset %ENV on this system</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) You called <code>reset(&#39;E&#39;)</code> or similar, which tried to reset all variables in the current package beginning with &quot;E&quot;. In the main package, that includes %ENV. Resetting %ENV is not supported on some systems, notably VMS.</p>

<p>(F)(P) Error resolving overloading specified by a method name (as opposed to a subroutine reference): no such method callable via the package. If the method name is <code>???</code>, this is an internal error.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Cant-return-s-from-lvalue-subroutine">Can&#39;t return %s from lvalue subroutine</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) Perl detected an attempt to return illegal lvalues (such as temporary or readonly values) from a subroutine used as an lvalue. This is not allowed.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Cant-return-outside-a-subroutine">Can&#39;t return outside a subroutine</dt>

<p>(F) The return statement was executed in mainline code, that is, where there was no subroutine call to return out of. See <a href="/cperl/perlsub.html">perlsub</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Cant-return-s-to-lvalue-scalar-context">Can&#39;t return %s to lvalue scalar context</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) You tried to return a complete array or hash from an lvalue subroutine, but you called the subroutine in a way that made Perl think you meant to return only one value. You probably meant to write parentheses around the call to the subroutine, which tell Perl that the call should be in list context.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Cant-stat-script-s">Can&#39;t stat script &quot;%s&quot;</dt>

<p>(F) You can&#39;t undefine a routine that&#39;s currently running. You can, however, redefine it while it&#39;s running, and you can even undef the redefined subroutine while the old routine is running. Go figure.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Cant-unweaken-a-nonreference">Can&#39;t unweaken a nonreference</dt>

<dt id="Cant-upgrade-s-d-to-d">Can&#39;t upgrade %s (%d) to %d</dt>
<dd>

<p>(P) The internal sv_upgrade routine adds &quot;members&quot; to an SV, making it into a more specialized kind of SV. The top several SV types are so specialized, however, that they cannot be interconverted. This message indicates that such a conversion was attempted.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Cant-use-c-after--mname">Can&#39;t use &#39;%c&#39; after -mname</dt>

<p>(F) You tried to call perl with the <b>-m</b> switch, but you put something other than &quot;=&quot; after the module name.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Cant-use-a-hash-as-a-reference">Can&#39;t use a hash as a reference</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) You tried to use a hash as a reference, as in <code>%foo-&gt;{&quot;bar&quot;}</code> or <code>%$ref-&gt;{&quot;hello&quot;}</code>. Versions of perl &lt;= 5.22.0 used to allow this syntax, but shouldn&#39;t have. This was deprecated in perl 5.6.1.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Cant-use-an-array-as-a-reference">Can&#39;t use an array as a reference</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) You tried to use an array as a reference, as in <code>@foo-&gt;[23]</code> or <code>@$ref-&gt;[99]</code>. Versions of perl &lt;= 5.22.0 used to allow this syntax, but shouldn&#39;t have. This was deprecated in perl 5.6.1.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Cant-use-anonymous-symbol-table-for-method-lookup">Can&#39;t use anonymous symbol table for method lookup</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) The internal routine that does method lookup was handed a symbol table that doesn&#39;t have a name. Symbol tables can become anonymous for example by undefining stashes: <code>undef %Some::Package::</code>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Cant-use-an-undefined-value-as-s-reference">Can&#39;t use an undefined value as %s reference</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) A value used as either a hard reference or a symbolic reference must be a defined value. This helps to delurk some insidious errors.</p>

<dd>

<p>(F) Only hard references are allowed by &quot;strict refs&quot;. Symbolic references are disallowed. See <a href="/cperl/perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Cant-use-because-Errno.pm-is-not-available">Can&#39;t use %! because Errno.pm is not available</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) The first time the <code>%!</code> hash is used, perl automatically loads the Errno.pm module. The Errno module is expected to tie the %! hash to provide symbolic names for <code>$!</code> errno values.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Cant-use-both-and-after-type-c-in-s">Can&#39;t use both &#39;&lt;&#39; and &#39;&gt;&#39; after type &#39;%c&#39; in %s</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) A type cannot be forced to have both big-endian and little-endian byte-order at the same time, so this combination of modifiers is not allowed. See <a href="/cperl/perlfunc.html#pack">&quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Cant-use-defined-array-Maybe-you-should-just-omit-the-defined">Can&#39;t use &#39;defined(@array)&#39; (Maybe you should just omit the defined()?)</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) defined() is not useful on arrays because it checks for an undefined <i>scalar</i> value. If you want to see if the array is empty, just use <code>if (@array) { # not empty }</code> for example.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Cant-use-defined-hash-Maybe-you-should-just-omit-the-defined">Can&#39;t use &#39;defined(%hash)&#39; (Maybe you should just omit the defined()?)</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) <code>defined()</code> is not usually right on hashes.</p>

<p>Although <code>defined %hash</code> is false on a plain not-yet-used hash, it becomes true in several non-obvious circumstances, including iterators, weak references, stash names, even remaining true after <code>undef %hash</code>. These things make <code>defined %hash</code> fairly useless in practice, so it now generates a fatal error.</p>

<p>If a check for non-empty is what you wanted then just put it in boolean context (see <a href="/cperl/perldata.html#Scalar-values">&quot;Scalar values&quot; in perldata</a>):</p>

<pre><code>    if (%hash) {
       # not empty
    }</code></pre>

<p>If you had <code>defined %Foo::Bar::QUUX</code> to check whether such a package variable exists then that&#39;s never really been reliable, and isn&#39;t a good way to enquire about the features of a package, or whether it&#39;s loaded, etc.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Cant-use-s-for-loop-variable">Can&#39;t use %s for loop variable</dt>

<p>(P) The parser got confused when trying to parse a <code>foreach</code> loop.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Cant-use-global-s-in-s">Can&#39;t use global %s in &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) You tried to declare a magical variable as a lexical variable. This is not allowed, because the magic can be tied to only one location (namely the global variable) and it would be incredibly confusing to have variables in your program that looked like magical variables but weren&#39;t.</p>

<p>In perl5 lexical <code>$_</code> was an experimental feature, which was removed with perl 5.24.0. The previous warning message <code>Use of my $_ is experimental</code> causes now the error <code>Can&#39;t use global $_ in &quot;my&quot;</code>.</p>

<p>In cperl <code>my $_</code> is considered natural syntax and works as expected. And is of course faster than global or localized <code>$_</code>. There&#39;s <code>no warnings &#39;experimental::lexical_topic&#39;</code> needed.</p>

<p><a href="/cperl/perlfunc.html#given">&quot;given&quot; in perlfunc</a> expressions are now safe to use in cperl and match will capture <code>$_</code> properly. There will be no such warning or error for <code>$_</code>.</p>

<dt id="Cant-use-c-in-a-group-with-different-byte-order-in-s">Can&#39;t use &#39;%c&#39; in a group with different byte-order in %s</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) You attempted to force a different byte-order on a type that is already inside a group with a byte-order modifier. For example you cannot force little-endianness on a type that is inside a big-endian group.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Cant-use-my-s-in-sort-comparison">Can&#39;t use &quot;my %s&quot; in sort comparison</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) The global variables $a and $b are reserved for sort comparisons. You mentioned $a or $b in the same line as the &lt;=&gt; or cmp operator, and the variable had earlier been declared as a lexical variable. Either qualify the sort variable with the package name, or rename the lexical variable.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Cant-use-s-ref-as-s-ref">Can&#39;t use %s ref as %s ref</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) You&#39;ve mixed up your reference types. You have to dereference a reference of the type needed. You can use the ref() function to test the type of the reference, if need be.</p>

<dd>

<p>(F) You&#39;ve told Perl to dereference a string, something which <code>use strict</code> blocks to prevent it happening accidentally. See <a href="/cperl/perlref.html#Symbolic-references">&quot;Symbolic references&quot; in perlref</a>. This can be triggered by an <code>@</code> or <code>$</code> in a double-quoted string immediately before interpolating a variable, for example in <code>&quot;user @$twitter_id&quot;</code>, which says to treat the contents of <code>$twitter_id</code> as an array reference; use a <code>\</code> to have a literal <code>@</code> symbol followed by the contents of <code>$twitter_id</code>: <code>&quot;user \@$twitter_id&quot;</code>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Cant-use-subscript-on-s">Can&#39;t use subscript on %s</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) The compiler tried to interpret a bracketed expression as a subscript. But to the left of the brackets was an expression that didn&#39;t look like a hash or array reference, or anything else subscriptable.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Cant-use-c-to-mean-c-in-expression">Can&#39;t use \%c to mean $%c in expression</dt>
<dd>

<p>(W syntax) In an ordinary expression, backslash is a unary operator that creates a reference to its argument. The use of backslash to indicate a backreference to a matched substring is valid only as part of a regular expression pattern. Trying to do this in ordinary Perl code produces a value that prints out looking like SCALAR(0xdecaf). Use the $1 form instead.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Cant-weaken-a-nonreference">Can&#39;t weaken a nonreference</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) You attempted to weaken something that was not a reference. Only references can be weakened.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Cant-when-outside-a-topicalizer">Can&#39;t &quot;when&quot; outside a topicalizer</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) You have used a when() block that is neither inside a <code>foreach</code> loop nor a <code>given</code> block. (Note that this error is issued on exit from the <code>when</code> block, so you won&#39;t get the error if the match fails, or if you use an explicit <code>continue</code>.)</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Cant-x-to-read-only-value">Can&#39;t x= to read-only value</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) You tried to repeat a constant value (often the undefined value) with an assignment operator, which implies modifying the value itself. Perhaps you need to copy the value to a temporary, and repeat that.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Character-following-c-must-be-printable-ASCII">Character following &quot;\c&quot; must be printable ASCII</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) In <code>\c<i>X</i></code>, <i>X</i> must be a printable (non-control) ASCII character.</p>

<p>Note that ASCII characters that don&#39;t map to control characters are discouraged, and will generate the warning (when enabled) <a href="#c-c-is-more-clearly-written-simply-as-s">&quot;&quot;\c%c&quot; is more clearly written simply as &quot;%s&quot;&quot;</a>.</p>

<p>(F) (In the above the <code>%c</code> is replaced by either <code>p</code> or <code>P</code>.) You specified something that isn&#39;t a legal Unicode property name. Most Unicode properties are specified by <code>\p{...}</code>. But if the name is a single character one, the braces may be omitted.</p>

<p>(W unpack) You tried something like</p>

<pre><code>   unpack(&quot;H&quot;, &quot;\x{2a1}&quot;)</code></pre>

<p>where the format expects to process a byte (a character with a value below 256), but a higher value was provided instead. Perl uses the value modulus 256 instead, as if you had provided:</p>

<p>(W pack) You said</p>

<pre><code>    pack(&quot;U0W&quot;, $x)</code></pre>

<p>where $x is either less than 0 or more than 255. However, <code>U0</code>-mode expects all values to fall in the interval [0, 255], so Perl behaved as if you meant:</p>

<dd>

<p>(F) You defined a character name which had multiple space characters in a row. Change them to single spaces. Usually these names are defined in the <code>:alias</code> import argument to <code>use charnames</code>, but they could be defined by a translator installed into <code>$^H{charnames}</code>.

<p>(F) You defined a character name which ended in a space character. Remove the trailing space(s). Usually these names are defined in the <code>:alias</code> import argument to <code>use charnames</code>, but they could be defined by a translator installed into <code>$^H{charnames}</code>.

<p>(F) The \C character class used to allow a match of single byte within a multi-byte utf-8 character, but was removed in v5.24 as it broke encapsulation and its implementation was extremely buggy. If you really need to process the individual bytes, you probably want to convert your string to one where each underlying byte is stored as a character, with utf8::encode().</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Code-missing-after">Code missing after &#39;/&#39;</dt>

<p>(F) You had a (sub-)template that ends with a &#39;/&#39;. There must be another template code following the slash. See <a href="/cperl/perlfunc.html#pack">&quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc</a>.</p>

<p>(S non_unicode) You had a code point that has never been in any standard, so it is likely that languages other than Perl will NOT understand it. At one time, it was legal in some standards to have code points up to 0x7FFF_FFFF, but not higher, and this code point is higher.</p>

<p>Acceptance of these code points is a Perl extension, and you should expect that nothing other than Perl can handle them; Perl itself on EBCDIC platforms before v5.24 does not handle them.</p>

<p>Code points above 0xFFFF_FFFF require larger than a 32 bit word.</p>

<p>Perl also makes no guarantees that the representation of these code points won&#39;t change at some point in the future, say when machines become available that have larger than a 64-bit word. At that time, files written by an older Perl would require conversion before being readable by a newer Perl.</p>

<p>(S non_unicode) You had a code point above the Unicode maximum of U+10FFFF.</p>

<p>Perl allows strings to contain a superset of Unicode code points, but these may not be accepted by other languages/systems. Further, even if these languages/systems accept these large code points, they may have chosen a different representation for them than the UTF-8-like one that Perl has, which would mean files are not exchangeable between them and Perl.</p>

<p>On EBCDIC platforms, code points above 0x3FFF_FFFF have a different representation in Perl v5.24 than before, so any file containing these that was written before that version will require conversion before being readable by a later Perl.</p>

<p>(D deprecated) You wrote something like</p>

<pre><code>    my $var;

<p>but $var is referenced elsewhere and could be modified after the <code>sub</code> expression is evaluated. Either it is explicitly modified elsewhere (<code>$var = 3</code>) or it is passed to a subroutine or to an operator like <code>printf</code> or <code>map</code>, which may or may not modify the variable.</p>

<p>Traditionally, Perl has captured the value of the variable at that point and turned the subroutine into a constant eligible for inlining. In those cases where the variable can be modified elsewhere, this breaks the behavior of closures, in which the subroutine captures the variable itself, rather than its value, so future changes to the variable are reflected in the subroutine&#39;s return value.</p>

<p>This usage is deprecated, and will no longer be allowed in Perl 5.32, making it possible to change the behavior in the future.</p>

<p>(D deprecated) Previously <code> do &quot;somefile&quot;; </code> would search the current directory for the specified file. Since perl v5.26.0, <i>.</i> has been removed from <code>@INC</code> by default, so this is no longer true.

<p>(S syntax) This is an educated guess made in conjunction with the message &quot;%s found where operator expected&quot;. It often means a subroutine or module name is being referenced that hasn&#39;t been declared yet. This may be because of ordering problems in your file, or because of a missing &quot;sub&quot;, &quot;package&quot;, &quot;require&quot;, or &quot;use&quot; statement. If you&#39;re referencing something that isn&#39;t defined yet, you don&#39;t actually have to define the subroutine or package before the current location. You can use an empty &quot;sub foo;&quot; or &quot;package FOO;&quot; to enter a &quot;forward&quot; declaration.</p>

<p>(S syntax) There is no keyword &quot;elseif&quot; in Perl because Larry thinks it&#39;s ugly. Your code will be interpreted as an attempt to call a method named &quot;elseif&quot; for the class returned by the following block. This is unlikely to be what you want.</p>

<p>(F) The maximal size of all <code>%ENV</code> variable keys and values being summed up may not exceed the system ARG_MAX limits. This is potentially insecure, and will lead to &quot;Argument list too long&quot; kernel errors on the next exec call, action at a distance.</p>

<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Because Perl may have to deal with file specifications in either VMS or Unix syntax, it converts them to a single form when it must operate on them directly. Either you&#39;ve passed an invalid file specification to Perl, or you&#39;ve found a case the conversion routines don&#39;t handle. Drat.</p>

<p>(F) Perl tried to compile a regular expression containing the <code>(?{ ... })</code> zero-width assertion at run time, as it would when the pattern contains interpolated values. Since that is a security risk, it is not allowed. If you insist, you may still do this by using the <code>re &#39;eval&#39;</code> pragma or by explicitly building the pattern from an interpolated string at run time and using that in an eval().

<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS. Something untoward happened in a VMS system service or RTL routine; Perl&#39;s exit status should provide more details. The filename in &quot;at %s&quot; and the line number in &quot;line %d&quot; tell you which section of the Perl source code is distressed.</p>

<p>(W pack) Each line in an uuencoded string starts with a length indicator which can&#39;t encode values above 63. So there is no point in asking for a line length bigger than that. Perl will behave as if you specified <code>u63</code> as the format.</p>

<p>(D deprecated) <code>File::Glob</code> has a function called <code>glob</code>, which just calls <code>bsd_glob</code>. However, its prototype is different from the prototype of <code>CORE::glob</code>, and hence, <code>File::Glob::glob</code> should not be used.</p>

<p><code>File::Glob::glob()</code> was deprecated in perl 5.8.0. A deprecation message was issued from perl 5.26.0 onwards, and the function will disappear in perl 5.30.0.</p>

<p>(W io) You tried to write on a read-only filehandle.

If you intended only to read from the file, use &quot;&lt;&quot;. See <a href="/cperl/perlfunc.html#open">&quot;open&quot; in perlfunc</a>. Another possibility is that you attempted to open filedescriptor 0 (also known as STDIN) for output (maybe you closed STDIN earlier?).</p>

<dt id="flock-on-closed-filehandle-s">flock() on closed filehandle %s</dt>
<dd>

<p>(W closed) The filehandle you&#39;re attempting to flock() got itself closed some time before now. Check your control flow. flock() operates on filehandles. Are you attempting to call flock() on a dirhandle by the same name?</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Format-not-terminated">Format not terminated</dt>

<dt id="glob-failed-s">glob failed (%s)</dt>
<dd>

<p>(S glob) Something went wrong with the external program(s) used for <code>glob</code> and <code>&lt;*.c&gt;</code>. Usually, this means that you supplied a <code>glob</code> pattern that caused the external program to fail and exit with a nonzero status. If the message indicates that the abnormal exit resulted in a coredump, this may also mean that your csh (C shell) is broken. If so, you should change all of the csh-related variables in config.sh: If you have tcsh, make the variables refer to it as if it were csh (e.g. <code>full_csh=&#39;/usr/bin/tcsh&#39;</code>); otherwise, make them all empty (except that <code>d_csh</code> should be <code>&#39;undef&#39;</code>) so that Perl will think csh is missing. In either case, after editing config.sh, run <code>./Configure -S</code> and rebuild Perl.</p>

<p>(F) The lexer saw a left angle bracket in a place where it was expecting a term, so it&#39;s looking for the corresponding right angle bracket, and not finding it. Chances are you left some needed parentheses out earlier in the line, and you really meant a &quot;less than&quot;.</p>

Generally maximal 8 collisions appear in normal hash table usage. Every 8th such hash flood attack performs a sleep(2) to limit the impact.</p>

<p>As every security warning this is prefixed with &quot;SECURITY: &quot; and has attacker specific suffices: The username, REMOTE_ADDR, application path. (cperl only)</p>

<p>(W overflow) The hexadecimal floating point had internally more digits than could be output. This can be caused by unsupported long double formats, or by 64-bit integers not being available (needed to retrieve the digits under some configurations).</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Hexadecimal-float:-unsupported-long-double-format">Hexadecimal float: unsupported long double format</dt>

<p>(F) You have configured Perl to use long doubles but the internals of the long double format are unknown; therefore the hexadecimal float output is impossible.</p>

<p>(F) Perl normally treats carriage returns in the program text as it would any other whitespace, which means you should never see this error when Perl was built using standard options. For some reason, your version of Perl appears to have been built without this support. Talk to your Perl administrator.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Illegal-character-in-prototype-for-s-:-s">Illegal character in prototype for %s : %s</dt>
<dd>

<p>(W illegalproto) An illegal character was found in a prototype declaration. Legal characters in prototypes are $, @, %, *, ;, [, ], &amp;, \, and +.</p>

<p>With perl5 perhaps you were trying to write a subroutine signature but didn&#39;t enable that feature first (<code>use feature &#39;signatures&#39;</code>), so your signature was instead interpreted as a bad prototype. With cperl this error can only happen with <code>\0</code> or with an explicit illegal prototype in a <code>:prototype()</code> attribute.</p>

<p>(F) You specified a Unicode-like property name in a regular expression pattern (using <code>\p{}</code> or <code>\P{}</code>) that Perl knows isn&#39;t an official Unicode property, and was likely meant to be a user-defined property name, but it can&#39;t be one of those, as they must begin with either <code>In</code> or <code>Is</code>.

</dd>
<dt id="Ill-formed-message-in-prime_env_iter:-s">Ill-formed message in prime_env_iter: |%s|</dt>

<p>(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS. Perl tried to read a logical name or CLI symbol definition when preparing to iterate over %ENV, and didn&#39;t see the expected delimiter between key and value, so the line was ignored.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="in-cleanup-s">(in cleanup) %s</dt>
<dd>

<p>(W misc) This prefix usually indicates that a DESTROY() method raised the indicated exception. Since destructors are usually called by the system at arbitrary points during execution, and often a vast number of times, the warning is issued only once for any number of failures that would otherwise result in the same message being repeated.</p>

<p>Failure of user callbacks dispatched using the <code>G_KEEPERR</code> flag could also result in this warning. See <a href="/cperl/perlcall.html#G_KEEPERR">&quot;G_KEEPERR&quot; in perlcall</a>.</p>

<p>(S overflow) The number you have passed to srand is too big to fit in your architecture&#39;s integer representation.

<p>Previously sysread() and recv() currently use only the <code>:utf8</code> flag for the stream, ignoring the actual layers. Since sysread() and recv() did no UTF-8 validation they can end up creating invalidly encoded scalars.</p>

<dd>

<p>(W locale) You are using the named UTF-8 locale. UTF-8 locales are expected to have very particular behavior, which most do. This message arises when perl found some departures from the expectations, and is notifying you that the expected behavior overrides these differences. In some cases the differences are caused by the locale definition being defective, but the most common causes of this warning are when there are ambiguities and conflicts in following the Standard, and the locale has chosen an approach that differs from Perl&#39;s.</p>

<p>One of these is because that, contrary to the claims, Unicode is not completely locale insensitive. Turkish and some related languages have two types of <code>&quot;I&quot;</code> characters. One is dotted in both upper- and lowercase, and the other is dotless in both cases. Unicode allows a locale to use either the Turkish rules, or the rules used in all other instances, where there is only one type of <code>&quot;I&quot;</code>, which is dotless in the uppercase, and dotted in the lower. The perl core does not (yet) handle the Turkish case, and this message warns you of that. Instead, the <a>Unicode::Casing</a> module allows you to mostly implement the Turkish casing rules.</p>

<p>The other common cause is for the characters</p>

<pre><code> $ + &lt; = &gt; ^ ` | ~</code></pre>

<p>These are probematic. The C standard says that these should be considered punctuation in the C locale (and the POSIX standard defers to the C standard), and Unicode is generally considered a superset of the C locale. But Unicode has added an extra category, &quot;Symbol&quot;, and classifies these particular characters as being symbols. Most UTF-8 locales have them treated as punctuation, so that <a href="http://man.he.net/man2/ispunct">ispunct(2)</a> returns non-zero for them. But a few locales have it return 0. Perl takes the first approach, not using <code>ispunct()</code> at all (see <a href="/cperl/perlrecharclass.html#pod-5">Note [5] in perlrecharclass</a>), and this message is raised to notify you that you are getting Perl&#39;s approach, not the locale&#39;s.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Locale-s-may-not-work-well.-s">Locale &#39;%s&#39; may not work well.%s</dt>
<dd>

<p>(W locale) You are using the named locale, which is a non-UTF-8 one, and which perl has determined is not fully compatible with what it can handle. The second <code>%s</code> gives a reason.</p>

<p>By far the most common reason is that the locale has characters in it that are represented by more than one byte. The only such locales that Perl can handle are the UTF-8 locales. Most likely the specified locale is a non-UTF-8 one for an East Asian language such as Chinese or Japanese. If the locale is a superset of ASCII, the ASCII portion of it may work in Perl.</p>

<p>Some essentially obsolete locales that aren&#39;t supersets of ASCII, mainly those in ISO 646 or other 7-bit locales, such as ASMO 449, can also have problems, depending on what portions of the ASCII character set get changed by the locale and are also used by the program. The warning message lists the determinable conflicting characters.</p>

<p>Note that not all incompatibilities are found.</p>

<p>If this happens to you, there&#39;s not much you can do except switch to use a different locale or use <a href="/cperl/lib/Encode.html">Encode</a> to translate from the locale into UTF-8; if that&#39;s impracticable, you have been warned that some things may break.</p>

<p>This message is output once each time a bad locale is switched into within the scope of <code><span style="white-space: nowrap;">use locale</span></code>, or on the first possibly-affected operation if the <code><span style="white-space: nowrap;">use locale</span></code> inherits a bad one.

Unicode properties are only defined on Unicode code points, so the result of this match is undefined by Unicode, but Perl (starting in v5.20) treats non-Unicode code points as if they were typical unassigned Unicode ones, and matched this one accordingly. Whether a given property matches these code points or not is specified in <a href="/cperl/perluniprops.html#Properties-accessible-through-p-and-P">&quot;Properties accessible through \p{} and \P{}&quot; in perluniprops</a>.</p>

<p>This message is suppressed (unless it has been made fatal) if it is immaterial to the results of the match if the code point is Unicode or not. For example, the property <code>\p{ASCII_Hex_Digit}</code> only can match the 22 characters <code>[0-9A-Fa-f]</code>, so obviously all other code points, Unicode or not, won&#39;t match it. (And <code>\P{ASCII_Hex_Digit}</code> will match every code point except these 22.)</p>

<p>Getting this message indicates that the outcome of the match arguably should have been the opposite of what actually happened. If you think that is the case, you may wish to make the <code>non_unicode</code> warnings category fatal; if you agree with Perl&#39;s decision, you may wish to turn off this category.</p>

<dt id="Missing-right-brace-on-N-or-unescaped-left-brace-after-N">Missing right brace on \N{} or unescaped left brace after \N</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) <code>\N</code> has two meanings.</p>

<p>The traditional one has it followed by a name enclosed in braces, meaning the character (or sequence of characters) given by that name. Thus <code>\N{ASTERISK}</code> is another way of writing <code>*</code>, valid in both double-quoted strings and regular expression patterns. In patterns, it doesn&#39;t have the meaning an unescaped <code>*</code> does.</p>

<p>Starting in Perl 5.12.0, <code>\N</code> also can have an additional meaning (only) in patterns, namely to match a non-newline character. (This is short for <code>[^\n]</code>, and like <code>.</code> but is not affected by the <code>/s</code> regex modifier.)</p>

<p>This can lead to some ambiguities. When <code>\N</code> is not followed immediately by a left brace, Perl assumes the <code>[^\n]</code> meaning. Also, if the braces form a valid quantifier such as <code>\N{3}</code> or <code>\N{5,}</code>, Perl assumes that this means to match the given quantity of non-newlines (in these examples, 3; and 5 or more, respectively). In all other case, where there is a <code>\N{</code> and a matching <code>}</code>, Perl assumes that a character name is desired.</p>

<p>However, if there is no matching <code>}</code>, Perl doesn&#39;t know if it was mistakenly omitted, or if <code>[^\n]{</code> was desired, and raises this error. If you meant the former, add the right brace; if you meant the latter, escape the brace with a backslash, like so: <code>\N\{</code></p>

</dd>
<dt id="Missing-right-curly-or-square-bracket">Missing right curly or square bracket</dt>

</dd>
<dt id="Modification-of-a-read-only-value-attempted">Modification of a read-only value attempted</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) You tried, directly or indirectly, to change the value of a constant. You didn&#39;t, of course, try &quot;2 = 1&quot;, because the compiler catches that. But an easy way to do the same thing is:</p>

<pre><code>    sub mod { $_[0] = 1 }
    mod(2);</code></pre>

<p>Another way is to assign to a substr() that&#39;s off the end of the string.</p>

<p>Yet another way is to assign to a <code>foreach</code> loop <i>VAR</i> when <i>VAR</i> is aliased to a constant in the look <i>LIST</i>:</p>

<pre><code>    $x = 1;
    foreach my $n ($x, 2) {

<p>This warning is only enabled with the lexical <code>syntax</code> warnings category and will disappear with v5.30c.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre><code>  sub foo{} my %h; foo (@h{&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;}); # keys %h was 2, now 0
  sub foo{} my %h; foo (%h{&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;}); # keys %h was 2, now 0</code></pre>

<p>Portable fix to avoid this warning: Use a temp. array for the hash slice.</p>

<pre><code>  sub foo{}
  my %h;
  my @temp = @h{&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;};
  foo(@temp); # keys %h =&gt; 0</code></pre>

</dd>
<dt id="No-code-specified-for---c">No code specified for -%c</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) Perl&#39;s <b>-e</b> and <b>-E</b> command-line options require an argument. If you want to run an empty program, pass the empty string as a separate argument or run a program consisting of a single 0 or 1:</p>

<pre><code>    perl -e &quot;&quot;
    perl -e0
    perl -e1</code></pre>

</dd>
<dt id="No-comma-allowed-after-s">No comma allowed after %s</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) A list operator that has a filehandle or &quot;indirect object&quot; is not allowed to have a comma between that and the following arguments. Otherwise it&#39;d be just another one of the arguments.</p>

<p>One possible cause for this is that you expected to have imported a constant to your name space with <b>use</b> or <b>import</b> while no such importing took place, it may for example be that your operating system does not support that particular constant. Hopefully you did use an explicit import list for the constants you expect to see; please see <a href="/cperl/perlfunc.html#use">&quot;use&quot; in perlfunc</a> and <a href="/cperl/perlfunc.html#import">&quot;import&quot; in perlfunc</a>. While an explicit import list would probably have caught this error earlier it naturally does not remedy the fact that your operating system still does not support that constant. Maybe you have a typo in the constants of the symbol import list of <b>use</b> or <b>import</b> or in the constant name at the line where this error was triggered?</p>

<dt id="No-command-into-which-to-pipe-on-command-line">No command into which to pipe on command line</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl handles its own command line redirection, and found a &#39;|&#39; at the end of the command line, so it doesn&#39;t know where you want to pipe the output from this command.</p>

<p>(F) The function requires more arguments than you specified.</p>

<p>This error might be detected at compile-time or run-time.</p>

<p>If the called function is declared with a signature, and the error message includes &quot;Want: \d, but got: 0&quot;, it might be that the call <code>&amp;$sub</code> without <code>()</code> needs to be replaced with a <code>goto \&amp;sub;</code>.

</dd>
<dt id="Number-with-no-digits">Number with no digits</dt>

<p>(F) A subroutine using a slurpy hash parameter in its signature received an odd number of arguments to populate the hash. It requires the arguments to be paired, with the same number of keys as values. The caller of the subroutine is presumably at fault. Inconveniently, this error will be reported at the location of the subroutine, not that of the caller.</p>

<p>(W misc) A map block which is assigned to a hash produced an odd number of elements, which is odd, because hashes come in key/value pairs. This warning is only printed once at the very first map iteration. Four or more values are still valid though, they create two or more pairs.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Offset-outside-string">Offset outside string</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F)(W layer) You tried to do a read/write/send/recv/seek operation with an offset pointing outside the buffer. This is difficult to imagine. The sole exceptions to this are that zero padding will take place when going past the end of the string when either <code>sysread()</code>ing a file, or when seeking past the end of a scalar opened for I/O (in anticipation of future reads and to imitate the behavior with real files).</p>

<dd>

<p>(S non_unicode) You performed an operation requiring Unicode rules on a code point that is not in Unicode, so what it should do is not defined. Perl has chosen to have it do nothing, and warn you.</p>

<p>If the operation shown is &quot;ToFold&quot;, it means that case-insensitive matching in a regular expression was done on the code point.</p>

<p>If you know what you are doing you can turn off this warning by <code>no warnings &#39;non_unicode&#39;;</code>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Operation-s-returns-its-argument-for-UTF-16-surrogate-U-X">Operation &quot;%s&quot; returns its argument for UTF-16 surrogate U+%X</dt>
<dd>

<p>(S surrogate) You performed an operation requiring Unicode rules on a Unicode surrogate. Unicode frowns upon the use of surrogates for anything but storing strings in UTF-16, but rules are (reluctantly) defined for the surrogates, and they are to do nothing for this operation. Because the use of surrogates can be dangerous, Perl warns.</p>

<p>If the operation shown is &quot;ToFold&quot;, it means that case-insensitive matching in a regular expression was done on the code point.</p>

<p>If you know what you are doing you can turn off this warning by <code>no warnings &#39;surrogate&#39;;</code>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Operator-or-semicolon-missing-before-s">Operator or semicolon missing before %s</dt>
<dd>

<p>(S ambiguous) You used a variable or subroutine call where the parser was expecting an operator. The parser has assumed you really meant to use an operator, but this is highly likely to be incorrect. For example, if you say &quot;*foo *foo&quot; it will be interpreted as if you said &quot;*foo * &#39;foo&#39;&quot;.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Optional-parameter-lacks-default-expression">Optional parameter lacks default expression</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) In a subroutine signature, you wrote something like &quot;$a =&quot;, making a named optional parameter without a default value. A nameless optional parameter is permitted to have no default value, but a named one must have a specific default. You probably want &quot;$a = undef&quot;.</p>

<dd>

<p>(X) The malloc() function returned 0, indicating there was insufficient remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the request. Perl has no option but to exit immediately.</p>

<p>At least in Unix you may be able to get past this by increasing your process datasize limits: in csh/tcsh use <code>limit</code> and <code>limit datasize n</code> (where <code>n</code> is the number of kilobytes) to check the current limits and change them, and in ksh/bash/zsh use <code>ulimit -a</code> and <code>ulimit -d n</code>, respectively.</p>

<dt id="Out-of-memory-during-large-request-for-s">Out of memory during &quot;large&quot; request for %s</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) The malloc() function returned 0, indicating there was insufficient remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the request. However, the request was judged large enough (compile-time default is 64K), so a possibility to shut down by trapping this error is granted.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Out-of-memory-during-request-for-s">Out of memory during request for %s</dt>
<dd>

<p>(X)(F) The malloc() function returned 0, indicating there was insufficient remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the request.</p>

<p>The request was judged to be small, so the possibility to trap it depends on the way perl was compiled. By default it is not trappable. However, if compiled for this, Perl may use the contents of <code>$^M</code> as an emergency pool after die()ing with this message. In this case the error is trappable <i>once</i>, and the error message will include the line and file where the failed request happened.</p>

<p>Exactly what were the failed locale settings varies. In the above the settings were that the LC_ALL was &quot;En_US&quot; and the LANG had no value.

<p>(W regexp) Perl thinks that you intended to write a POSIX character class, but didn&#39;t use enough brackets. These POSIX class constructs [: :], [= =], and [. .] go <i>inside</i> character classes, the [] are part of the construct, for example: <code>qr/[012[:alpha:]345]/</code>. What the regular expression pattern compiled to is probably not what you were intending. For example, <code>qr/[:alpha:]/</code> compiles to a regular bracketed character class consisting of the four characters <code>&quot;:&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;a&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;l&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;h&quot;</code>, and <code>&quot;p&quot;</code>. To specify the POSIX class, it should have been written <code>qr/[[:alpha:]]/</code>.</p>

<p>Note that [= =] and [. .] are not currently implemented; they are simply placeholders for future extensions and will cause fatal errors. The <span style="white-space: nowrap;">&lt;-- HERE</span> shows whereabouts in the regular expression the problem was discovered. See <a href="/cperl/perlre.html">perlre</a>.</p>

<dt id="Possible-memory-corruption:-s-overflowed-3rd-argument">Possible memory corruption: %s overflowed 3rd argument</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) An ioctl() or fcntl() returned more than Perl was bargaining for. Perl guesses a reasonable buffer size, but puts a sentinel byte at the end of the buffer just in case. This sentinel byte got clobbered, and Perl assumes that memory is now corrupted. See <a href="/cperl/perlfunc.html#ioctl">&quot;ioctl&quot; in perlfunc</a>.</p>

<dt id="Possible-precedence-issue-with-control-flow-operator">Possible precedence issue with control flow operator</dt>
<dd>

<p>(W syntax) There is a possible problem with the mixing of a control flow operator (e.g. <code>return</code>) and a low-precedence operator like <code>or</code>. Consider:</p>

<pre><code>    sub { return $a or $b; }</code></pre>

<p>This is parsed as:</p>

<pre><code>    sub { (return $a) or $b; }</code></pre>

<p>Which is effectively just:</p>

<pre><code>    sub { return $a; }</code></pre>

<p>Either use parentheses or the high-precedence variant of the operator.</p>

<p>Note this may be also triggered for constructs like:</p>

<pre><code>    sub { 1 if die; }</code></pre>

</dd>
<dt id="Possible-precedence-problem-on-bitwise-s-operator">Possible precedence problem on bitwise %s operator</dt>

<p>(W precedence) Your program uses a bitwise logical operator in conjunction with a numeric comparison operator, like this :</p>

<pre><code>    if ($x &amp; $y == 0) { ... }</code></pre>

<p>This expression is actually equivalent to <code>$x &amp; ($y == 0)</code>, due to the higher precedence of <code>==</code>. This is probably not what you want. (If you really meant to write this, disable the warning, or, better, put the parentheses explicitly and write <code>$x &amp; ($y == 0)</code>).</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Possible-unintended-interpolation-of-in-regex">Possible unintended interpolation of $\ in regex</dt>
<dd>

<p>(W ambiguous) You said something like <code>m/$\/</code> in a regex. The regex <code>m/foo$\s+bar/m</code> translates to: match the word &#39;foo&#39;, the output record separator (see <a href="/cperl/perlvar.html#pod">&quot;$\&quot; in perlvar</a>) and the letter &#39;s&#39; (one time or more) followed by the word &#39;bar&#39;.</p>

<p>If this is what you intended then you can silence the warning by using <code>m/${\}/</code> (for example: <code>m/foo${\}s+bar/</code>).</p>

<p>If instead you intended to match the word &#39;foo&#39; at the end of the line followed by whitespace and the word &#39;bar&#39; on the next line then you can use <code>m/$(?)\/</code> (for example: <code>m/foo$(?)\s+bar/</code>).</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Possible-unintended-interpolation-of-s-in-string">Possible unintended interpolation of %s in string</dt>

<pre><code>    open(FOO || die);</code></pre>

<p>because of the strict regularization of Perl 5&#39;s grammar into unary and list operators. (The old open was a little of both.) You must put parentheses around the filehandle, or use the new &quot;or&quot; operator instead of &quot;||&quot;.</p>

If you did intend a range, the one that was used is not portable between ASCII and EBCDIC platforms, and doesn&#39;t have an obvious meaning to a casual reader.</p>

<p>(You can force portability by specifying a Unicode range, which means that the endpoints are specified by <a href="/cperl/perlrecharclass.html#Character-Ranges"><code>\N{...}</code></a>, but the meaning may still not be obvious.) The stricter rules require that ranges that start or stop with an ASCII character that is not a control have all their endpoints be the literal character, and not some escape sequence (like <code>&quot;\x41&quot;</code>), and the ranges must be all digits, or all uppercase letters, or all lowercase letters.</p>

The difference is that <code>$foo{&amp;bar}</code> always behaves like a scalar, both when assigning to it and when evaluating its argument, while <code>@foo{&amp;bar}</code> behaves like a list when you assign to it, and provides a list context to its subscript, which can do weird things if you&#39;re expecting only one subscript.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you were actually hoping to treat the hash element as a list, you need to look into how references work, because Perl will not magically convert between scalars and lists for you. See <a href="/cperl/perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>

<p>(A) This is the error message generally seen in a browser window when trying to run a CGI program (including SSI) over the web. The actual error text varies widely from server to server. The most frequently-seen variants are &quot;500 Server error&quot;, &quot;Method (something) not permitted&quot;, &quot;Document contains no data&quot;, &quot;Premature end of script headers&quot;, and &quot;Did not produce a valid header&quot;.</p>

<p><b>This is a CGI error, not a Perl error</b>.</p>

<p>You need to make sure your script is executable, is accessible by the user CGI is running the script under (which is probably not the user account you tested it under), does not rely on any environment variables (like PATH) from the user it isn&#39;t running under, and isn&#39;t in a location where the CGI server can&#39;t find it, basically, more or less.

<p>(F) You assigned a reference to a scalar to <code>$/</code> where the referenced item is not a positive integer. In older perls this <b>appeared</b> to work the same as setting it to <code>undef</code> but was in fact internally different, less efficient and with very bad luck could have resulted in your file being split by a stringified form of the reference.</p>

<p>In Perl 5.20.0 this was changed so that it would be <b>exactly</b> the same as setting <code>$/</code> to undef, with the exception that this warning would be thrown.</p>

<p>You are recommended to change your code to set <code>$/</code> to <code>undef</code> explicitly if you wish to slurp the file. As of Perl 5.28 assigning <code>$/</code> to a reference to an integer which isn&#39;t positive is a fatal error.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Subroutine-s-is-not-available">Subroutine &quot;&amp;%s&quot; is not available</dt>
<dd>

<p>(W closure) During compilation, an inner named subroutine or eval is attempting to capture an outer lexical subroutine that is not currently available. This can happen for one of two reasons. First, the lexical subroutine may be declared in an outer anonymous subroutine that has not yet been created. (Remember that named subs are created at compile time, while anonymous subs are created at run-time.) For example,</p>

<pre><code>    sub { my sub a {...} sub f { \&amp;a } }</code></pre>

<p>At the time that f is created, it can&#39;t capture the current &quot;a&quot; sub, since the anonymous subroutine hasn&#39;t been created yet. Conversely, the following won&#39;t give a warning since the anonymous subroutine has by now been created and is live:</p>

<pre><code>    sub { my sub a {...} eval &#39;sub f { \&amp;a }&#39; }-&gt;();</code></pre>

<p>The second situation is caused by an eval accessing a lexical subroutine that has gone out of scope, for example,</p>

<pre><code>    sub f {
        my sub a {...}
        sub { eval &#39;\&amp;a&#39; }
    }
    f()-&gt;();</code></pre>

<p>Here, when the &#39;\&amp;a&#39; in the eval is being compiled, f() is not currently being executed, so its &amp;a is not available for capture.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Subroutine-s-will-not-stay-shared">Subroutine &quot;%s&quot; will not stay shared</dt>
<dd>

<p>(W closure) An inner (nested) <i>named</i> subroutine is referencing a &quot;my&quot; subroutine defined in an outer named subroutine.</p>

<p>When the inner subroutine is called, it will see the value of the outer subroutine&#39;s lexical subroutine as it was before and during the *first* call to the outer subroutine; in this case, after the first call to the outer subroutine is complete, the inner and outer subroutines will no longer share a common value for the lexical subroutine. In other words, it will no longer be shared. This will especially make a difference if the lexical subroutines accesses lexical variables declared in its surrounding scope.</p>

<p>This problem can usually be solved by making the inner subroutine anonymous, using the <code>sub {}</code> syntax. When inner anonymous subs that reference lexical subroutines in outer subroutines are created, they are automatically rebound to the current values of such lexical subs.</p>

<p>Often there will be another error message associated with the syntax error giving more information. (Sometimes it helps to turn on <b>-w</b>.) The error message itself often tells you where it was in the line when it decided to give up. Sometimes the actual error is several tokens before this, because Perl is good at understanding random input. Occasionally the line number may be misleading, and once in a blue moon the only way to figure out what&#39;s triggering the error is to call <code>perl -c</code> repeatedly, chopping away half the program each time to see if the error went away.

<dt id="This-use-of-my-in-false-conditional-is-no-longer-allowed">This use of my() in false conditional is no longer allowed</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) You used a declaration similar to <code>my $x if 0</code>. There has been a long-standing bug in Perl that causes a lexical variable not to be cleared at scope exit when its declaration includes a false conditional. Some people have exploited this bug to achieve a kind of static variable. Since we intend to fix this bug, we don&#39;t want people relying on this behavior. You can achieve a similar static effect by declaring the variable in a separate block outside the function, eg</p>

<pre><code>    sub f { my $x if 0; return $x++ }</code></pre>

<p>becomes</p>

<pre><code>    { my $x; sub f { return $x++ } }</code></pre>

<p>Beginning with perl 5.10.0, you can also use <code>state</code> variables to have lexicals that are initialized only once (see <a href="/cperl/lib/feature.html">feature</a>):</p>

<p>(X) The #! line (or local equivalent) in a Perl script contains the <b>-T</b> option (or the <b>-t</b> option), but Perl was not invoked with <b>-T</b> in its command line. This is an error because, by the time Perl discovers a <b>-T</b> in a script, it&#39;s too late to properly taint everything from the environment. So Perl gives up.</p>

<p>If the Perl script is being executed as a command using the #! mechanism (or its local equivalent), this error can usually be fixed by editing the #! line so that the <b>-%c</b> option is a part of Perl&#39;s first argument: e.g. change <code>perl -n -%c</code> to <code>perl -%c -n</code>.</p>

<p>If the Perl script is being executed as <code>perl scriptname</code>, then the <b>-%c</b> option must appear on the command line: <code>perl -%c scriptname</code>.</p>

<p>In the case of <b>-M</b> and <b>-m</b>, this is an error because those options are not intended for use inside scripts. Use the <code>use</code> pragma instead.</p>

<p>The <b>-C</b> option only works if it is specified on the command line as well (with the same sequence of letters or numbers following). Either specify this option on the command line, or, if your system supports it, make your script executable and run it directly instead of passing it to perl.</p>

<dd>

<p>(W regexp) The simple rule to remember, if you want to match a literal <code>&quot;{&quot;</code> character (U+007B <code>LEFT CURLY BRACKET</code>) in a regular expression pattern, is to escape each literal instance of it in some way. Generally easiest is to precede it with a backslash, like <code>&quot;\{&quot;</code> or enclose it in square brackets (<code>&quot;[{]&quot;</code>). If the pattern delimiters are also braces, any matching right brace (<code>&quot;}&quot;</code>) should also be escaped to avoid confusing the parser, for example,</p>

<pre><code> qr{abc\{def\}ghi}</code></pre>

<p>Forcing literal <code>&quot;{&quot;</code> characters to be escaped will enable the Perl language to be extended in various ways in future releases. To avoid needlessly breaking existing code, the restriction is is not enforced in contexts where there are unlikely to ever be extensions that could conflict with the use there of <code>&quot;{&quot;</code> as a literal.</p>

<p>In this release of Perl, some literal uses of <code>&quot;{&quot;</code> are fatal, and some still just deprecated. This is because of an oversight: some uses of a literal <code>&quot;{&quot;</code> that should have raised a deprecation warning starting in v5.20 did not warn until v5.26. By making the already-warned uses fatal now, some of the planned extensions can be made to the language sooner. The cases which are still allowed will be fatal in Perl 5.30 or 5.32, but cperl allows more. In cperl only the combinations with <code>\NpPbBxog{}</code> are illegal.</p>

<p>The contexts where no warnings or errors are raised are:</p>

<p>Within the scope of <code><span style="white-space: nowrap;">use re &#39;strict&#39;</span></code> in a regular expression pattern, you included an unescaped <code>}</code> or <code>]</code> which was interpreted literally. These two characters are sometimes metacharacters, and sometimes literals, depending on what precedes them in the pattern. This is unlike the similar <code>)</code> which is always a metacharacter unless escaped.</p>

<p>This action at a distance, perhaps a large distance, can lead to Perl silently misinterpreting what you meant, so when you specify that you want extra checking by <code><span style="white-space: nowrap;">use re &#39;strict&#39;</span></code>, this warning is generated. If you meant the character as a literal, simply confirm that to Perl by preceding the character with a backslash, or make it into a bracketed character class (like <code>[}]</code>). If you meant it as closing a corresponding <code>[</code> or <code>{</code>, you&#39;ll need to look back through the pattern to find out why that isn&#39;t happening.</p>

<dt id="Useless-use-of-s-in-void-context">Useless use of %s in void context</dt>
<dd>

<p>(W void) You did something without a side effect in a context that does nothing with the return value, such as a statement that doesn&#39;t return a value from a block, or the left side of a scalar comma operator. Very often this points not to stupidity on your part, but a failure of Perl to parse your program the way you thought it would. For example, you&#39;d get this if you mixed up your C precedence with Python precedence and said</p>

<pre><code>    $one, $two = 1, 2;</code></pre>

<p>when you meant to say</p>

<pre><code>    ($one, $two) = (1, 2);</code></pre>

<p>Another common error is to use ordinary parentheses to construct a list reference when you should be using square or curly brackets, for example, if you say</p>

<pre><code>    $array = (1,2);</code></pre>

<p>when you should have said</p>

<pre><code>    $array = [1,2];</code></pre>

<p>The square brackets explicitly turn a list value into a scalar value, while parentheses do not. So when a parenthesized list is evaluated in a scalar context, the comma is treated like C&#39;s comma operator, which throws away the left argument, which is not what you want. See <a href="/cperl/perlref.html">perlref</a> for more on this.</p>

<p>You are not supposed to modify arrays while they are being iterated over. For speed and efficiency reasons, Perl internally does not do full reference-counting of iterated items, hence deleting such an item in the middle of an iteration causes Perl to see a freed value.</p>

<dt id="Use-of-unassigned-code-point-or-non-standalone-grapheme-for-a-delimiter-is-not-allowed">Use of unassigned code point or non-standalone grapheme for a delimiter is not allowed</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) A grapheme is what appears to a native-speaker of a language to be a character. In Unicode (and hence Perl) a grapheme may actually be several adjacent characters that together form a complete grapheme. For example, there can be a base character, like &quot;R&quot; and an accent, like a circumflex &quot;^&quot;, that appear when displayed to be a single character with the circumflex hovering over the &quot;R&quot;. Perl currently allows things like that circumflex to be delimiters of strings, patterns, <i>etc</i>. When displayed, the circumflex would look like it belongs to the character just to the left of it. In order to move the language to be able to accept graphemes as delimiters, we cannot allow the use of delimiters which aren&#39;t graphemes by themselves. Also, a delimiter must already be assigned (or known to be never going to be assigned) to try to future-proof code, for otherwise code that works today would fail to compile if the currently unassigned delimiter ends up being something that isn&#39;t a stand-alone grapheme. Because Unicode is never going to assign <a href="/cperl/perlunicode.html#Noncharacter-code-points">non-character code points</a>, nor <a>code points that are above the legal Unicode maximum</a>, those can be delimiters, and their use is legal. I.e. <code>qr &#x302;foobar&#x302;</code> is invalid.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Use-of-uninitialized-value-s">Use of uninitialized value%s</dt>
<dd>

<p>(W uninitialized) An undefined value was used as if it were already defined. It was interpreted as a &quot;&quot; or a 0, but maybe it was a mistake. To suppress this warning assign a defined value to your variables.</p>

<p>To help you figure out what was undefined, perl will try to tell you the name of the variable (if any) that was undefined. In some cases it cannot do this, so it also tells you what operation you used the undefined value in. Note, however, that perl optimizes your program and the operation displayed in the warning may not necessarily appear literally in your program. For example, <code>&quot;that $foo&quot;</code> is usually optimized into <code>&quot;that &quot; . $foo</code>, and the warning will refer to the <code>concatenation (.)</code> operator, even though there is no <code>.</code> in your program.</p>

Even though a character class is supposed to match just one character of input, perl will match the whole thing correctly, except when the class is inverted (<code>[^...]</code>), or the escape is the beginning or final end point of a range. For these, what should happen isn&#39;t clear at all. In these circumstances, Perl discards all but the first character of the returned sequence, which is not likely what you want.</p>

<dd>

<p>(W regexp) You used a Unicode boundary (<code>\b{...}</code> or <code>\B{...}</code>) in a portion of a regular expression where the character set modifiers <code>/a</code> or <code>/aa</code> are in effect. These two modifiers indicate an ASCII interpretation, and this doesn&#39;t make sense for a Unicode definition. The generated regular expression will compile so that the boundary uses all of Unicode. No other portion of the regular expression is affected.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Using-with-s-doesnt-make-sense">Using !~ with %s doesn&#39;t make sense</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) Using the <code>!~</code> operator with <code>s///r</code>, <code>tr///r</code> or <code>y///r</code> is currently reserved for future use, as the exact behavior has not been decided. (Simply returning the boolean opposite of the modified string is usually not particularly useful.)</p>

</dd>
<dt id="UTF-16-surrogate-U-X">UTF-16 surrogate U+%X</dt>
<dd>

<p>(S surrogate) You had a UTF-16 surrogate in a context where they are not considered acceptable. These code points, between U+D800 and U+DFFF (inclusive), are used by Unicode only for UTF-16. However, Perl internally allows all unsigned integer code points (up to the size limit available on your platform), including surrogates. But these can cause problems when being input or output, which is likely where this message came from. If you really really know what you are doing you can turn off this warning by <code>no warnings &#39;surrogate&#39;;</code>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Value-of-s-can-be-0-test-with-defined">Value of %s can be &quot;0&quot;; test with defined()</dt>
<dd>

<p>(W misc) In a conditional expression, you used &lt;HANDLE&gt;, &lt;*&gt; (glob), <code>each()</code>, or <code>readdir()</code> as a boolean value. Each of these constructs can return a value of &quot;0&quot;; that would make the conditional expression false, which is probably not what you intended. When using these constructs in conditional expressions, test their values with the <code>defined</code> operator.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Value-of-CLI-symbol-s-too-long">Value of CLI symbol &quot;%s&quot; too long</dt>
<dd>

<p>(W misc) A warning peculiar to VMS. Perl tried to read the value of an %ENV element from a CLI symbol table, and found a resultant string longer than 1024 characters. The return value has been truncated to 1024 characters.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Variable-s-is-not-available">Variable &quot;%s&quot; is not available</dt>
<dd>

<p>(W closure) During compilation, an inner named subroutine or eval is attempting to capture an outer lexical that is not currently available. This can happen for one of two reasons. First, the outer lexical may be declared in an outer anonymous subroutine that has not yet been created. (Remember that named subs are created at compile time, while anonymous subs are created at run-time.) For example,</p>

<pre><code>    sub { my $a; sub f { $a } }</code></pre>

<p>At the time that f is created, it can&#39;t capture the current value of $a, since the anonymous subroutine hasn&#39;t been created yet. Conversely, the following won&#39;t give a warning since the anonymous subroutine has by now been created and is live:</p>

<pre><code>    sub { my $a; eval &#39;sub f { $a }&#39; }-&gt;();</code></pre>

<p>The second situation is caused by an eval accessing a variable that has gone out of scope, for example,</p>

<pre><code>    sub f {
        my $a;
        sub { eval &#39;$a&#39; }
    }
    f()-&gt;();</code></pre>

<p>Here, when the &#39;$a&#39; in the eval is being compiled, f() is not currently being executed, so its $a is not available for capture.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Variable-s-is-not-imported-s">Variable &quot;%s&quot; is not imported%s</dt>
<dd>

<p>(S misc) With &quot;use strict&quot; in effect, you referred to a global variable that you apparently thought was imported from another module, because something else of the same name (usually a subroutine) is exported by that module. It usually means you put the wrong funny character on the front of your variable.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Variable-length-lookbehind-not-implemented-in-regex-m-s">Variable length lookbehind not implemented in regex m/%s/</dt>
<dd>

<p>(F) <b>This message no longer should be raised as of Perl 5.30.</b> It is retained in this document as a convenience for people using an earlier Perl version.</p>

<p>In Perl 5.30 and earlier, lookbehind is allowed only for subexpressions whose length is fixed and known at compile time. For positive lookbehind, you can use the <code>\K</code> regex construct as a way to get the equivalent functionality. See <a href="/cperl/perlre.html#K">(?&lt;=pattern) and \K in perlre</a>.</p>

<p>Starting in Perl 5.18, there are non-obvious Unicode rules under <code>/i</code> that can match variably, but which you might not think could. For example, the substring <code>&quot;ss&quot;</code> can match the single character LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S. Here&#39;s a complete list of the current ones affecting ASCII characters:</p>

<pre><code>   ASCII
  sequence      Matches single letter under /i
    FF          U+FB00 LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FF
    FFI         U+FB03 LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FFI
    FFL         U+FB04 LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FFL
    FI          U+FB01 LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FI
    FL          U+FB02 LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FL
    SS          U+00DF LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S
                U+1E9E LATIN CAPITAL LETTER SHARP S
    ST          U+FB06 LATIN SMALL LIGATURE ST
                U+FB05 LATIN SMALL LIGATURE LONG S T</code></pre>

<p>This list is subject to change, but is quite unlikely to. Each ASCII sequence can be any combination of upper- and lowercase.</p>

<p>You can avoid this by using a bracketed character class in the lookbehind assertion, like</p>

<pre><code> (?&lt;![sS]t)
 (?&lt;![fF]f[iI])</code></pre>

<p>This fools Perl into not matching the ligatures.</p>

<p>Another option for Perls starting with 5.16, if you only care about ASCII matches, is to add the <code>/aa</code> modifier to the regex. This will exclude all these non-obvious matches, thus getting rid of this message. You can also say</p>

<pre><code> use if $] ge 5.016, re =&gt; &#39;/aa&#39;;</code></pre>

<p>to apply <code>/aa</code> to all regular expressions compiled within its scope. See <a href="/cperl/lib/re.html">re</a>.</p>

<p>(W shadow) A &quot;my&quot;, &quot;our&quot; or &quot;state&quot; variable has been redeclared in the current scope or statement, effectively eliminating all access to the previous instance.

<p>(W closure) An inner (nested) <i>named</i> subroutine is referencing a lexical variable defined in an outer named subroutine.</p>

<p>When the inner subroutine is called, it will see the value of the outer subroutine&#39;s variable as it was before and during the *first* call to the outer subroutine; in this case, after the first call to the outer subroutine is complete, the inner and outer subroutines will no longer share a common value for the variable. In other words, the variable will no longer be shared.</p>

<p>This problem can usually be solved by making the inner subroutine anonymous, using the <code>sub {}</code> syntax. When inner anonymous subs that reference variables in outer subroutines are created, they are automatically rebound to the current values of such variables.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Warning:-unable-to-close-filehandle-s-properly:-s">Warning: unable to close filehandle %s properly: %s</dt>
<dd>

<p>(S io) There were errors during the implicit close() done on a filehandle when its reference count reached zero while it was still open, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>    {
        open my $fh, &#39;&gt;&#39;, $file  or die &quot;open: &#39;$file&#39;: $!\n&quot;;
        print $fh $data or die &quot;print: $!&quot;;
    } # implicit close here</code></pre>

<p>Because various errors may only be detected by close() (e.g. buffering could allow the <code>print</code> in this example to return true even when the disk is full), it is dangerous to ignore its result. So when it happens implicitly, perl will signal errors by warning.</p>

<p><b>Prior to version 5.22.0, perl ignored such errors</b>, so the common idiom shown above was liable to cause <b>silent data loss</b>.</p>

<pre><code>    rand + 5;</code></pre>

<p>you may THINK you wrote the same thing as</p>

<pre><code>    rand() + 5;</code></pre>

<p>but in actual fact, you got</p>

<p>So put in parentheses to say what you really mean.</p>

<dt id="Wide-character-in-s">Wide character in %s</dt>
<dd>

<p>(S utf8) Perl met a wide character (ordinal &gt;255) when it wasn&#39;t expecting one. This warning is by default on for I/O (like print).</p>

<p>If this warning does come from I/O, the easiest way to quiet it is simply to add the <code>:utf8</code> layer, <i>e.g.</i>, <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>binmode STDOUT, &#39;:utf8&#39;</code></span>. Another way to turn off the warning is to add <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>no warnings &#39;utf8&#39;;</code></span> but that is often closer to cheating. In general, you are supposed to explicitly mark the filehandle with an encoding, see <a href="/cperl/lib/open.html">open</a> and <a href="/cperl/perlfunc.html#binmode">&quot;binmode&quot; in perlfunc</a>.</p>

<p>If the warning comes from other than I/O, this diagnostic probably indicates that incorrect results are being obtained. You should examine your code to determine how a wide character is getting to an operation that doesn&#39;t handle them.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Wide-character-U-X-in-s">Wide character (U+%X) in %s</dt>
<dd>

<p>(W locale) While in a single-byte locale (<i>i.e.</i>, a non-UTF-8 one), a multi-byte character was encountered. Perl considers this character to be the specified Unicode code point. Combining non-UTF-8 locales and Unicode is dangerous. Almost certainly some characters will have two different representations. For example, in the ISO 8859-7 (Greek) locale, the code point 0xC3 represents a Capital Gamma. But so also does 0x393. This will make string comparisons unreliable.</p>

<p>You likely need to figure out how this multi-byte character got mixed up with your single-byte locale (or perhaps you thought you had a UTF-8 locale, but Perl disagrees).</p>

There is a vulnerability anywhere that you have a set-id script, and to close it you need to remove the set-id bit from the script that you&#39;re attempting to run.
