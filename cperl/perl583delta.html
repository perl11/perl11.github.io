<h1 id="NAME">NAME</h1>

<p>perl583delta - what is new for perl v5.8.3</p>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>This document describes differences between the 5.8.2 release and the 5.8.3 release.</p>

<p>If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.6.1, first read the <a href="/cperl/perl58delta.html">perl58delta</a>, which describes differences between 5.6.0 and 5.8.0, and the <a href="/cperl/perl581delta.html">perl581delta</a> and <a href="/cperl/perl582delta.html">perl582delta</a>, which describe differences between 5.8.0, 5.8.1 and 5.8.2</p>

<h1 id="Incompatible-Changes">Incompatible Changes</h1>

<p>There are no changes incompatible with 5.8.2.</p>

<h1 id="Core-Enhancements">Core Enhancements</h1>

<p>A <code>SCALAR</code> method is now available for tied hashes. This is called when a tied hash is used in scalar context, such as</p>

<pre><code>    if (%tied_hash) {
        ...
    }</code></pre>

<p>The old behaviour was that %tied_hash would return whatever would have been returned for that hash before the hash was tied (so usually 0). The new behaviour in the absence of a SCALAR method is to return TRUE if in the middle of an <code>each</code> iteration, and otherwise call FIRSTKEY to check if the hash is empty (making sure that a subsequent <code>each</code> will also begin by calling FIRSTKEY). Please see <a href="/cperl/perltie.html#SCALAR">&quot;SCALAR&quot; in perltie</a> for the full details and caveats.</p>

</dl>

<h1 id="Utility-Changes">Utility Changes</h1>

<p><code>find2perl</code> now assumes <code>-print</code> as a default action. Previously, it needed to be specified explicitly.</p>

<p>A new utility, <code>prove</code>, makes it easy to run an individual regression test at the command line. <code>prove</code> is part of Test::Harness, which users of earlier Perl versions can install from CPAN.</p>

<h1 id="New-Documentation">New Documentation</h1>

<p>The documentation has been revised in places to produce more standard manpages.</p>

<p>The documentation for the special code blocks (BEGIN, CHECK, INIT, END) has been improved.</p>

<h1 id="Installation-and-Configuration-Improvements">Installation and Configuration Improvements</h1>

<p>Perl now builds on OpenVMS I64</p>

<h1 id="Selected-Bug-Fixes">Selected Bug Fixes</h1>

<p>Using substr() on a UTF8 string could cause subsequent accesses on that string to return garbage. This was due to incorrect UTF8 offsets being cached, and is now fixed.</p>

<p>join() could return garbage when the same join() statement was used to process 8 bit data having earlier processed UTF8 data, due to the flags on that statement&#39;s temporary workspace not being reset correctly. This is now fixed.</p>

<p><code>$a .. $b</code> will now work as expected when either $a or $b is <code>undef</code></p>

<p>Using Unicode keys with tied hashes should now work correctly.</p>

<p>Reading $^E now preserves $!. Previously, the C code implementing $^E did not preserve <code>errno</code>, so reading $^E could cause <code>errno</code> and therefore <code>$!</code> to change unexpectedly.</p>

<p>Reentrant functions will (once more) work with C++. 5.8.2 introduced a bugfix which accidentally broke the compilation of Perl extensions written in C++</p>

<h1 id="New-or-Changed-Diagnostics">New or Changed Diagnostics</h1>

<p>The fatal error &quot;DESTROY created new reference to dead object&quot; is now documented in <a href="/cperl/perldiag.html">perldiag</a>.</p>

<h1 id="Changed-Internals">Changed Internals</h1>

<p>The hash code has been refactored to reduce source duplication. The external interface is unchanged, and aside from the bug fixes described above, there should be no change in behaviour.</p>

<p><code>hv_clear_placeholders</code> is now part of the perl API</p>

<p>Some C macros have been tidied. In particular macros which create temporary local variables now name these variables more defensively, which should avoid bugs where names clash.</p>

<p>&lt;signal.h&gt; is now always included.</p>

<h1 id="Configuration-and-Building">Configuration and Building</h1>

<p><code>Configure</code> now invokes callbacks regardless of the value of the variable they are called for. Previously callbacks were only invoked in the <code>case $variable $define)</code> branch. This change should only affect platform maintainers writing configuration hints files.</p>

<h1 id="Platform-Specific-Problems">Platform Specific Problems</h1>

<p>The regression test ext/threads/shared/t/wait.t fails on early RedHat 9 and HP-UX 10.20 due to bugs in their threading implementations. RedHat users should see https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2003-136.html and consider upgrading their glibc.</p>

<h1 id="Known-Problems">Known Problems</h1>

<p>Detached threads aren&#39;t supported on Windows yet, as they may lead to memory access violation problems.</p>

<p>There is a known race condition opening scripts in <code>suidperl</code>. <code>suidperl</code> is neither built nor installed by default, and has been deprecated since perl 5.8.0. You are advised to replace use of suidperl with tools such as sudo ( http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/ )</p>

<p>We have a backlog of unresolved bugs. Dealing with bugs and bug reports is unglamorous work; not something ideally suited to volunteer labour, but that is all that we have.</p>

<p>The perl5 development team are implementing changes to help address this problem, which should go live in early 2004.</p>

<h1 id="Future-Directions">Future Directions</h1>

<p>Code freeze for the next maintenance release (5.8.4) is on March 31st 2004, with release expected by mid April. Similarly 5.8.5&#39;s freeze will be at the end of June, with release by mid July.</p>

<h1 id="Obituary">Obituary</h1>

<p>Iain &#39;Spoon&#39; Truskett, Perl hacker, author of <a href="/cperl/perlreref.html">perlreref</a> and contributor to CPAN, died suddenly on 29th December 2003, aged 24. He will be missed.</p>

<h1 id="Reporting-Bugs">Reporting Bugs</h1>

<p>If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at http://bugs.perl.org. There may also be information at http://www.perl.org, the Perl Home Page.</p>

<p>If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the <b>perlbug</b> program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of <code>perl -V</code>, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team. You can browse and search the Perl 5 bugs at http://bugs.perl.org/</p>
